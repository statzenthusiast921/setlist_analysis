Tame Impala,The Less I Know the Better,"162 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsItalianoDeutschThe Less I Know the Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise, leanin' on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

[Verse 2]
She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever""
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

Tame Impala,"New Person, Same Old Mistakes","106 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoFrançaisDeutschفارسیEspañolNew Person, Same Old Mistakes Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried, but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
I know…
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
I know there's too much at stake
Making the same mistakes
And I still don't know why it's happening
Stop while it's not too late
And I still don't know…

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinkin' in black and white
Thinkin' it's worth the fight
Soon I'll be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
So how do I know I've gone too far?
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late

[Bridge]
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
Feel like a brand-new person
I finally know what it's like
Stop thinking that the only option was…
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
And I know it's hard to describe
Stop thinking that the only option was…

It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
""Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen""

[Chorus]
All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning

[Verse 2]
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

[Chorus]
All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my take-off fails, make up some other story
But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry

Tame Impala,Yes I’m Changing,"68 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolYes I’m Changing Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was raging, it was late
In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once
Yes, I'm changing, yes, I'm gone
Yes, I'm older, yes, I'm moving on
And if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along with me
Life is moving, can't you see?
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby, now there's nothing left that

[Chorus]
I can do
So don't be blue
There is another future waiting there for you

[Verse 2]
I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change but that's bullshit, they do
Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted, I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame

Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make, that makes you cry
I'm as pathetic, as the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I got for you (Uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware, not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?

Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way

Whenever troubled times arose

I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust

You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I suffered
What a thing to discover
If there was time to recover

Tame Impala,Love/Paranoia,"48 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolLove/Paranoia Lyrics[Verse 1]
I may not be as honest as I ought to be
Now that, when the walls go up
I said it didn't worry me but it hit me like an arrow
Babe, to know, I could just be paranoid
Won't quell the desire to know what was really going on
""Does it really fucking matter, babe?"" is all you can ask me
Okay, fair play, here we go

[Verse 2]
I've heard those words before
Are you sure it was nothing
'Cause it made me feel like dying inside
Never thought I was insecure, but it's pure
Didn't notice until I was in love for real
Am I really gonna cross the line
Just to find what you're typing?
If only I could read your mind
Ooh, I'd be fine, I'd be normal
But now’s my time, gonna do it

[Verse 3]
And suddenly I'm the phony one
The only one with a problem
True love is bringing it out of me
The worst in me, and I know now
Do you remember the time we were
The time we were by the ocean?
I didn't care if it was day or night
The world was right where I wanted

Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually, terrible memories turn into great ones

If they hold you, erase them

Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed somethin', don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day

Well, he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreamin' about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it's not like Mr. Shuck
To get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there
But he's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs
(Here he comes)

[Verse 2]
He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac (Yeah)
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back

Tame Impala,Past Life,"52 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPast Life Lyrics[Intro]
I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which is standard for me, Thursday, 12:30
I've got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know, it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving, I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rear-view mirror
But, in its reflection, just for a second
I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories flooded back, stopped me in my tracks
""Who was that?"" It was my lover
A lover from a past life

[Chorus]
From a past life
Feel like I saw a ghost
From a past life
So unexpected
From a past life
I was transfixed
From a past life

[Interlude]
Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal, poetic but uncertain
Like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to black out regret
But it was real, it just feels like a past life
You might also like[Chorus]
From a past life
Crazy
From a past life
It takes a lot to trip me out
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time in a long time
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)

[Interlude]
So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on, but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

[Chorus]
From a past life
I guess there's no harm in trying
From a past life
What's the worst that could happen?
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time
In a long time
(I tried to say it but it never came out right)
Past life
From a past life
(You're not a stranger if you're always on my mind)
For the first time
(I know it's late, it just didn't feel right)
In a long time
[Outro]

But it's something I'm used to
And I could tell it by your face
No one's ever been rude to you
When I could tell you things
That I can't say to anyone
And you came 'round today
But you didn't stay very long

[Chorus]
Now it's like the world owes you
Walking around like everybody should know you
I wanna be like we used to
But now you're worried whose audience will lose you

[Verse 2]
And I had no idea
What that feeling could do to you
And I could tell you've changed
By the people around you
I used to take the long way
Just so I could walk past your door
I used to wait outside
But I guess I won't anymore

Just a moment
Right before all the song and dance
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
But there ain't gonna be another chance
It's not long until (All that I have)
And everything's still (One more hour)
Minutes are racing, whatever I've done
I did it for love (All that I have)
I did it for fun (One more hour)
Couldn't get enough (All that I have)
I did it for fame (One more hour)
But never for money
Not for houses, not for her
Not for my future children
Until now

[Verse 2]
How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore
(Lose her) How could I love again?
(Move on) How can I walk this path for sure?
(Lose her) With no more time to spare
(Move on) I know the answer more and more

It could be the day that all our dreams come true

Till we're at the end of just another day
Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

Never held something so close I couldn't keep
Into the day, the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear that

While I am just sitting here

Strung out again, but still on track

Tame Impala,The Boat I Row,"25 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsThe Boat I Row Lyrics[Verse 1]
Many ways to go
It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Saying, ""It's so obvious""
But really, they don't know (They don't know)
Just like a monster that is (Man or machine)
Only a shadow (A shadow)
From which I'm already runnin'

[Verse 2]
Easy, I suppose
And even if it takes
A hundred-thousand goes
The way's in front of me 'cause
That's the one I chose (I chose)
It's always starin' at you (Barely a choice)
That's the boat I row (I row)
And though it seems to be

[Chorus]
Endless problems
Relentless
I know I'm oblivious
Bit overzealous
And possibly jealous
I run till I'm breathless
Try to suppress it
I couldn't bear it, so onward, I go

To hide in the night
And blink at the door
You'd let it go
Though you'll never know
When it all may be gone
We close our heart
We shut down our world
To rumors you know
Tore down the shield
Your future reveals
Where the feel's yet to go

You've gotta open up your mind and feel the love in your life
You've got to open up your heart feel the love in your life
You've gotta open up your mind and feel the love in your life
You've got to open up your heart feel the love in your life
Love in your lifer heart
And feel love in the light

They won't decide
Watch time glassing by
Then float away

To divert with goodbyes

Gone a little far this time for something

Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna bе a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday

Cross your heart and hope to fade away
If I was the earth, you’d be the sun, no
You’d be the entire milky way;

Dancing round the Daddy's thin line
We could go frolic in the meadows
We could go swimming in the serpentine

Hold on you told me you had no
This side of you never show
I wouldn’t of wasted all this time
And I’d have you all to my own

Deep into the monsters eye
Dancing round the Daddy's thin line
We could go frolic in the meadows
We could go swimming in the serpentine

Oh, this feeling I’ve felt before
One of the visions you cannot ignore
I dunno what this feeling is for
I feel the love from you

She said it’s kinda like a dream

Tame Impala,One More Year (NTS Version),"5 ContributorsOne More Year (NTS Version) Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
Now I worry our horizon's been nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling, maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim has slowly become all we do

[Refrain]
All we do
And now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
And now it's all we live for
Might be what we die for
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's okay
I think I know a way
It's s-, it's so clear
Why don't we just say, ""One more year""?
One more year

Tame Impala,’Cause I’m A Man (HAIM Remix),"1 Contributor’Cause I’m A Man (HAIM Remix) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like the brutal autumn sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fucking doubt I make unleash a cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
'Cause I'm a man, woman
The only answer I've got for you
'Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force that I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
I have a conscience that is nеver fooled
But it's prone to bе overruled
You wanna know why I always think I'm right?
You never accept defeat and let it slide
I have no voice if I don't speak my mind
My weakness is the source of all my pride
And I'll tell you why

Bring back those good old days
Nothing feels right, nothing ever goes my way

Allow me to be your sponge

He woke up next to her, his head against her head
His hand upon her breast, he knew today meant death
He kissed her on the cheek, and then on her lips
Thought to himself: ""It's the last time I'll do this""

Put on a suit, pressed and clean
Then brushed his hair, grabbed his keys
Then he headed out to the morning air
With an anticipation no man could bear

[Verse 3]
The air was heavy, he could feel it in his lungs
With every step he took, a prayer rolled off his tongue
They were prayers of forgiveness
And prayers of praise
And his actions a gift for a god without a name

The same strut was in his walk
The same fire was in his eye
Before his child was even born
He'd already said his goodbyes

He was on an endless road, feeling like a king
Even after the initial bite, the wound still did sting

Watching repetitive wars do nothing but make fools of us
Its all just big business, using patriotism as a blindfold
And religion as a stronghold

Can we start over, rid of this disease, this clash of belief
Can we celebrate what we don't know?

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried, but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
I know…
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
I know there's too much at stake
Making the same mistakes
And I still don't know why it's happening
Stop while it's not too late
And I still don't know…

Knowing it all this time

But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

Feel like a brand-new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
Feel like a brand-new person

Just let it happen, let it happen""

A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning

It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry

Ah

[Verse 1]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for something
How was I to know?
How was I to know? This high came rushing

[Refrain]
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

[Verse 2]
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away

[Refrain]
We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday (If you and I get comfortable)
We're on the borderline (On the borderline)
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time (Then I saw the time)
Watched it speedin' by like a train, like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?

Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
If there's room, room for doubt
As within, as without ya
Will I be so in love?
Any closer? Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P., here comes the sun
Here comes the sun

[Verse 3]
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known?
How was I to know? This high came rushing
I said, ""Come with me outside""
I need to clear my mind, this weight is crushing
Do you see the light, oh
Coming from their eyes? Oh no
And I couldn't get away
[Refrain]
We're on the borderline (Ooh)
Gets me every time, these close encounters
Just to know I can (Just to know I can)
Once again, I am alone

[Chorus]
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough (I was fine without ya)
Will I be known and loved?
L.A. really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation, well, I tried (I was fine without ya)
Will I be? Stay right here
Any closer? Bad idea

Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make, that makes you cry
I'm as pathetic, as the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I got for you (Uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware, not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes

[Verse 2]
Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?

[Instrumental]

And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave

Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I suffered
What a thing to discover
If there was time to recover
One-on-one with each other
Just a boy and a father
What I'd give for another
Everything that I have
Wouldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time
That you left us alone

I may not be as honest as I ought to be
Now that, when the walls go up
I said it didn't worry me but it hit me like an arrow
Babe, to know, I could just be paranoid
Won't quell the desire to know what was really going on
""Does it really fucking matter, babe?"" is all you can ask me
Okay, fair play, here we go

[Verse 2]
I've heard those words before
Are you sure it was nothing
'Cause it made me feel like dying inside
Never thought I was insecure, but it's pure
Didn't notice until I was in love for real
Am I really gonna cross the line
Just to find what you're typing?
If only I could read your mind
Ooh, I'd be fine, I'd be normal
But now’s my time, gonna do it

[Verse 3]
And suddenly I'm the phony one
The only one with a problem
True love is bringing it out of me
The worst in me, and I know now
Do you remember the time we were
The time we were by the ocean?

Tame Impala,Past Life,"52 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPast Life Lyrics[Intro]
I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which is standard for me, Thursday, 12:30
I've got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know, it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving, I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rear-view mirror
But, in its reflection, just for a second
I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories flooded back, stopped me in my tracks
""Who was that?"" It was my lover
A lover from a past life

[Chorus]
From a past life
Feel like I saw a ghost
From a past life
So unexpected
From a past life
I was transfixed
From a past life

[Interlude]
Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal, poetic but uncertain
Like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to black out regret
But it was real, it just feels like a past life
You might also like[Chorus]
From a past life
Crazy
From a past life
It takes a lot to trip me out
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time in a long time
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)

[Interlude]
So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on, but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

[Chorus]
From a past life
I guess there's no harm in trying
From a past life
What's the worst that could happen?
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time
In a long time
(I tried to say it but it never came out right)
Past life
From a past life
(You're not a stranger if you're always on my mind)
For the first time
(I know it's late, it just didn't feel right)

Me and my love, we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long

Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge runnin' low
I tried to fill but it overflowed

Right before all the song and dance
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
But there ain't gonna be another chance
It's not long until (All that I have)
And everything's still (One more hour)
Minutes are racing, whatever I've done
I did it for love (All that I have)
I did it for fun (One more hour)
Couldn't get enough (All that I have)
I did it for fame (One more hour)
But never for money
Not for houses, not for her
Not for my future children
Until now

How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore

Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
But now I worry our horizons bear nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim
Has slowly become all we do

[Chorus]
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
And now I fear we might
Ooh, now I fear we might

[Post-Chorus]
But it's okay
I think there's a way
Why don't we just say, ""One more year""? (One more year)
Not worryin' if I get the right amount of sleep (One more year)
Not carin' if we do the same thing every week (One more year)
Of livin' like I'm only livin' for me (One more year)
Of never talkin' about where we're gonna be (One more year)
One more year
Of livin' like the free spirit I wanna be

There's no use trying to relate to that older soul
And no use trying to debate that they've got it wrong
There's no use pining for love when you're on your own
And no use crying outside if nobody's home
There's no use flying to the moon if they won't believe

Like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be learning fast
And the day will come and then it will pass

What do you want when I say I won't?
And though I try, I do the same, as though I must

Tame Impala,Stranger In Moscow,"5 ContributorsStranger In Moscow LyricsI was wandering in the rain (Mask of life, feelin' insane)
Swift and sudden fall from grace (Sunny days seem far away)
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me (Stalin's tomb won't let me be)
On and on and on it came

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame (Armageddon of the brain)
KGB was doggin' me (Take my name and just let me be)
Then a begger boy called my name (Happy days will drown the pain)
On and on and on it came

Shakin' his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreaming about
Being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim

And it’s not like Mister Shook to get shy
When they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down
In the dark down there
He’s not too easily scared

He’s got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now
Coming down the stairs

(Here he comes)

He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac
‘Cause he doesn’t like it looking
Like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact

Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remembered a thing
When they saw him again

We're called Tame Impala, and we love you guys
And this song is called, ""Apocalypse Dreams""
Alright, I said I'd ask Kevin a topical question
Haha, what?

[Verse 1]
This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
Till we're at the end of just another day
Oh, oh, oh my
Are you too terrified to try your best?
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it feels so real in my sleep
Never held something so close I couldn't keep
Into the day, the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear that

I have a conscience that is nеver fooled
But it's prone to bе overruled

To make your wallet fat
While mine's on a diet
It's not my greatest care
But simple needs are scarce
It's never ending
It really seems unfair
But lately I don't care
I don't care about much
I've given up trying

So sing about love
Sing about lust
So they will care
It's the same difference

That's what happens
When you play catch without arms
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart
Well that's what happens

With a spark to ignite the flame
And in this struggle of guilt to tame
It's freedom I'll obtain
She tied me up, removed my crown
Bittered all good taste
I'm sorry for everything I've done
I can't deny instinct

Look what I have found
A seashell in a sea of shells
I'm good at planting my own seeds
To sprout an endless hell
It's dark like Poe

Forgiveness came, we embrace the key
Found water to douse the flame
We ended our difference of soul and brain
Forever we are changed
I've just set out on a brand new race
Can we keep the pace
I can't believe what we've become

His hand upon her breast, he knew today meant death

Then brushed his hair, grabbed his keys
Then he headed out to the morning air
With an anticipation no man could bear

We are born into silence
And let it all be
Lift your anchor
And just float astray
Born into silence
And let it all be
Fortune in silence ...

[Break] HEY!

[Verse 1: Hayes]
Watch it explode
While fragments of irony's examples fly
And hit the shore
And tyranny's torn
From the podiums where leaders stand ...
But rule no more

[Chorus: Hayes]
Plead with nothing
Why don't we lecture about something?
Protest the way
We're passive today

Watch it explode
While it's not impossible for flowers to bloom and grow
Next to graves
And babies are born
In the same buildings where people go
To pass away

Resting gray hairs on wrinkled arms
With nothing but a stool to hold up his back
Skinny legs with Japanese mileage
Crossed at the ankles
He's unaware

Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it

Unaware of his surroundings
Youth, it passed
Swarming like wolves to a fresh kill
The scent attracts
He's just scared about dying

Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it

Save your clever statements

Sitting in the sand, watch the tide roll up
Take a deep breath in as your past fades out
Let everything else just fade into the horizon
When the planet stops spinning and the music stops
Take a deep breath in, let your life fade out
With everything else, you'll fade into the horizon

I'll never leave this place, where I was born
I need a little more information to add to this confusion
These delusions, they aren't meant to justify the things you do
Thankfully, I haven't been taken very seriously
Keep moving onward, keep moving onward
I don't know if I've been reborn, or lived a past life, suffered in another time
I'm gathering the pebbles, I need to drink from the well
We are all part of the problem
Just let go
Just let go
Just let go
Just let go

​dredg,Where I’ll End Up,"2 ContributorsWhere I’ll End Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
You say the sky's falling, but it's the earth rising
A perception as precious as some gold
You spend all of your time in front of the tunnel
At the beginning of the light
Scrambling for someone amongst the cold

[Chorus]
Well, I don't want to, but I have to
Where I'll end up I'm not really sure
Well, I don't want to, but I have to
Yes, I have to let you go

[Verse 2]
Change is calling, but your fears keep stalling
Your potential to progress and transform
You spend all of your time solving a puzzle
A beginning with no end in sight
A violent storm waiting to unfold

[Chorus]
Well, I don't want to, but I have to
Where I'll end up I'm not really sure

He lived the life, never offended, he played by the rules
Struck the right chords, he was never out of tune
Sacrificed every second for his kids and wife
Thought to himself, ""If I only had more time""

[Chorus]
He said, ""It's a problem that I'll solve
It's a problem to resolve someday""

Commuted daily to his high-tech job
Waited in line patiently with the rest of the mob
Now, a taste of success can forever jade
When the pink slip arrived, he'd finally lost his way

[Chorus]
He said, ""It's a problem that I'll solve

Even after the initial bite, the wound still did sting

The same strut was in his walk
The same fire was in his eye
Before his child was even born
He'd already said his goodbyes

And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get to sleep, no

(Hoo, yeah, haha)
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head
[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines 'til they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the verses and the corrosion
Have been after native in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, ""Taxi""
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies

Slow it down some, no split, clown bum
Your gold hits sound dumb, hold it now, crown 'em
Where you found them at?
Got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it
Would have floated, bloated, voted
Sugar-coated, loaded hip shooter
Draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast, roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Where did it go? What you want it to be?
Well, you know November has come

Aw, send 'em a gun and tell 'em, ""Clean it""

In my backpack, I got my act right in case you act quite difficult
And your result weaken with anger and discontent
Some are seekin' and searchin' like Nimoy
I'm a peace-loving decoy, ready for retaliation
I change your whole location to a pine box, six under
Impulsive, don't ask why or wonder
Orders given to me is strike and I'm thunder
With lightning-fast reflexes
On constant alert from the constant hurt
That seems limitless with no drop in pressure
It seems like everybody's out to test ya 'til they see you break
You can't conceal the hate that consumes you
I'm the reason why you fill up your Isuzu
Chill with your old lady at the tilt
I got a ninety-day extension and I'm filled with guilt
From things done and seen
Your water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteen
At night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeper
The cost of life, it seems to get cheaper
Out in the desert with my street sweeper
""The war is over"", so said the speaker
With the flight suit on
Maybe to him, I'm just a pawn
So he can advance
Remember when I used to dance?
Man, all I wanna do is dance

If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her
'Cause she's standing drama, she know I'll call her
She getting on the sun and then she order
Imagine me, imagine me now (She's my collar)
I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her
I take her down to somewhere drab and naughty
I clear my system, I don't need no other
This is my persona, secret lover (She's my collar)
Nothing to be justified in
Just one thing, you should feel nada
I know she lies alone, she's my caller
I sense her in my mind, she's my collar

She's the serpentine, she's my collar
I send a message, never call her
And now I wanna taste another

And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)

And you keep squeezing the tube from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You part the seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)
And you was gagging for some gags so now you're rolling (Woo)
Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)
On another note, compliments make me blush
There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
Cavern of your mind, you say you're patterned
You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say (Ah, ah, ah)

We all give applause when people open doors
But on the way out it did your back in
See, everything in life ain't silver and gold
But mining for metal gave you platinum

The polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you
It's all around you, out here

And if the whole world is crashing down (on you)
Fall through space out of mind with me

Blows all the shadows far away
The falling of the whole empire, is here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sleeps

If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come

This morning, you've got time for a hot home cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only three microwaved minutes
Are you kidding?!

[Verse: Gruff Rhys, De La Soul & Both]
Yo, retty packages of frosted delights
Look, it comes with a toy! I like that
I want a number four, number six, and throw in a plastic donut
Just enjoy the gritty crunch that tastes just like chicken
Rappers of many bite sizes
Man, are you freaking blind? That's a rock
All mixed in the pot full
Momma's homemade from scratch, but not quite (Nope!)
Toasted over flames they be tasting quite right

[Refrain: Posdnuos and (Dave)]
All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
""Don't waste time"" with your net
Our net worth is set
Ready, go many know others but
We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it
With the twenty-four hour sign
Shower mine habits
While you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots
(Oh that's chicken)
Gotta have it super fast

Gorillaz,Fire Coming Out of the Monkey’s Head,"93 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiPortuguêsNederlandsРусскийFire Coming Out of the Monkey’s Head Lyrics[Verse 1: Dennis Hopper]
Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here, they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses
But no one noticed them, they only saw shadows
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind

[Interlude: 2D]
Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

[Verse 2: Dennis Hopper]
In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
Its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep
And then came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany
So immense that it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called Monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then... nothing

Here is our tree
That primitively grows
And when you go to bed
Scarecrows from the far east
Come to eat its tender fruits
And I thought the best way to perfect our tree
Is by building walls
Walls like unicorns
In full glory and galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho
But glad then my friend
Out in the field, we shall reap a better day
What we have always dreamt of having
Are now for the starving
It is love, that is the root of all evil
But not our tree
And thank you, my friend
For trusting me

On a really hot day?
When the call got made
You had gone away

[Verse 1: Yukimi Nagano]
Waitin' by the mailbox, by the train
Passin' by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all I want is
Someone to rely on as thunder comes a-rolling down
Someone to rely on as the lightning comes a-staring in again

[Verse 2: 2-D]
I'll wait to be forgiven, maybe I never will
My star has left me to take the bitter pill
That shattered feeling, well, the cause of it's a lesson learned
""Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Just don't know if I could do it all again,"" she said—it's true

[Verse 3: Yukimi Nagano]
Waiting in my room, and I lock the door
I watch the coloured animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance and I'm listening to the whispers
And oh, it ain't the same, when you're falling out of feeling
And you're falling in and caught again
Cau-au-au-aught again

[Verse 4: 2-D]
I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry that you're feeling it
But I just have to tell you that I love you so much these days
Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true

Gorillaz,Out of Body,"91 ContributorsOut of Body Lyrics[Intro: Kilo Kish]
Pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
We're here tonight for a very special offering
An offering of our spirits this evening in unison
But first, a word of instruction

[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
Hello, hello
Please leave all your belongings at the door
You can sit or stand, we can take a vote
And just tiptoe to the centre of the circle
While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes
Some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
Ready, set, go
I lock hands with yours
We dive into the floor (drop)
When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more (drop)
I lock hands with yours
And then we dive down into the floor
Seven thousand miles 'til we reach the core
And then we circle back and we stomp some more, got it?
It's just like that
You promise all your life, then you turn your back
You glide across the space, and diagonal past
Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times, and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what any of this is about?
No? Well, work it out

[Verse 2: Kilo Kish]
Okay, slide like a lizard, walk like a crab
Eyes dilated, dark to the grass
Then when you find you're invisible, you melt into a puzzle
Keep it flowing like the rivers do
You gotta pay attention to the motion of the fish
Stay within the school or you're surely gonna miss
And if you lose your way, it's a cold black abyss
Don't take the chance, not worth the risk

In demon days, it's cold inside
You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are far too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that, yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down, falling down
Falling down to go far from the sun
[Chorus: The London Community Gospel Choir]
In these demon days, we're so cold inside
It's so hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth want us all to leave
When lies become reality
You numb yourself with drugs and TV
Pick yourself up, it's a brand new day
So turn yourself 'round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around to the sun
In these demon days, we're so cold inside

Momentary pain can be pleasure lain
Millisecond change; magic lantern strings
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian? Is this how it ends?
Girl, your life will turn, just like a strobe
'Cause your daddy's vain, and your mother won't
And your heart engages into heartless throes
Are we obsidian? Is this how it goes?

[Chorus: Peven Everett & The Humanz Choir]
If when your private life is dreaming
You're living the strobe light
And you will find the life you're needing
You're living the strobe light

[Verse 2: Peven Everett]
Slide the light off you, you may find some peace
All will come to you, if you come with me
Are we just too far to be as one again?
Are we obsidian? Is this how it is? Yeah

With the fall of man
They breathe you in

They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising

It's more than I can take

'Cause I lost my patience yesterday
If you could see inside of me
There'd be no heart on my X-ray
Opponents tryna checkmate
But I don't see no escape
Just tryna keep my head straight
On thin ice with the ice skates
At times, I feel like givin' up
'Cause it feels like I've had enough
Felt like my soul in handcuffs
Got questions with no answers
Can't help me out, I need a friend
I'm losin' faith in this world of sin
Tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
It's like a cycle that never ends
I can't contend with no handlin'
I can't take care of no grown man
All by myself, cryin' for help
But won't get saved by no Superman
All comes down to the mighty dollar
Greed and lust, abusin' power
Clock is tickin', hour after hour
Makes me wanna throw my hands and holler

Snatch a piece of my wonderin', distant-far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like, skin of my boot like
Fly in my soup like, ""Where's the waitress?""
Can I take this? Really, can I finish this?
These airs and all these graces
It's my mistake, I'll make it
J-dub to the boom, now make it
Bounce, wiggle, bounce, wiggle, shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats, bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted Cain, I'll twist again
I'll push the blade, as plain as day
Known to what these sayers say, known to what these doers do
It's you and who and you-know-where, we's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear, we happy on we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, it's start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach, the soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over, return of the ogre!

Man I came through with that big fat chain on my neck
Little did they know, no sweat
So I dimmed out, rimmed out and cracked the glass
Twenty-five pounds, can you match that bag?
'Cause if you not, raise up
I got a deal to make
And a couple bad bitches
I've been achin' to break
Wakin' and bake
I put the cake on the plate
Jealousy and me? Oh, we're making a date
I'ma vibe with this, Hollywood, nigga I'ma survive this shit

Forreal-a, gorilla, who loves goin' bareback
They wanna eye me down, tie me down, knock me off
But I'm a lion in the dogg pound

Got off a plane to the countryside
I drove to the mountain and a hole in the ground
There was crack on the corner and someone dead
And fire coming out of a monkey's head

[Chorus: The London Community Gospel Choir]
Don't get lost in heaven
They got locks on the gate
Don't go over the edge
You'll make a big mistake

[Verse 2: 2D]
Put me in a cab to suburbia
I just took a line, but it wasn't with ya
There was more of it there when I got back home
But you'd left me, you don't know my soul
You're a ho, girl

[Verse 1: 2D]
I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
A shadow in a corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if a get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say, ""I'm leaving"" to you
You've got a folding chair, and you don't know what to do
You'd sigh

[Chorus: James Murphy]
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doing, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doing?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

[Verse 2: 2D]
I'm impregnable, incredible, and set in the quo
I’m a late in my rider, not a heart and soul
I got a Saturday night, and nothing is dead
And if I ever had to do it, well, you know I wouldn’t care
I just get down, I love when I’m seen
And if I wanna talk back, the message is free
Then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
And if you get my tip, you get 'em a lot
You get a heart, ache

[Post-Chorus: Andre 3000]
Every time we try, we get nowhere
Wouldn't it be nice if we were just normal people? Yeah
Trying so hard to act like we don't care
But it's true you do, nothing is left so I guess I'm right
[Verse 3: André 3000]
New word - onomatopoeia (Boom)
Quit acting like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me alone
Get the fuck on, gone
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothing but the art of talking shit
My girl look pretty up there riding dick
My plaid past, my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an OutKast but you're into me
Summer got mad 'cause winter blew me
That juicy fruit, that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty-bloop
Get doop, gotta get doopty doop
Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney, I commend me
How come it be some lame ass nigga talking about, ""Ah, he don't rap enough?""
But y'all rap a lot, and I'm like wrap it up, ho
You ain't Scarface, you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick, you ain't killin' me
Better play with your motherfucking mama
Bet you still stay with your motherfucking mama
Keep sleeping on me, I'mma rock my pajamas
In the daytime, I swear, I promise
Dare a nigga say something, tear a nigga face off
How come blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white, know y'all can taste all
This fly shit, I stay finna take off

Sometime I wanna stand for somethin', then sometime wanna sit
Didn't really plan on cussin', but sometime it just slip
When you the mayonnaise and the mustard, you can't relish in it
And when them panties turn to custard, who the hell do they miss?
And when the nanny fucks the husband, what does she tell the kids?
That's a whole 'nother discussion, we can't fit in our kicks
That's a whole 'nother discussion, you can't fit in these kicks

That way, you won't be able to see the disappointment in my eyes

Nah, they don't lie (They don't lie), not to my eyes, (Not to my eyes), un-un

Welcome to the land of the permanent sun
Where the flowers are melted and the future is fun
The freeway lizards are not feeling so good
On a one-way trip back to West Hollywood, let's go

[Chorus: 2-D & Beck]
It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control
It feels so good to have a perfect song
It feels so good to be in total control

[Verse 2: 2-D]
There were spotlights flying through the sky
From the winter wonderland, catching out
The bees hiding in the grounds, no future Batman
Long before Christmas, not very likely
One-hundred million Viagra tablets
Starving away in the valley

[Chorus: 2-D & Beck]
It feels so good to have a perfect song (Uh-huh)
It feels so good to be in total control (Uh-huh)
It feels so good to have a perfect song (Uh-huh)

I'm going out with a bang and the fangs of a parasite
I'm feeling alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

[Verse 3: 2-D & Beck]
Untainted dreams, et cetera and forever
I hope, said no one
She's a plastic Cleopatra on a throne of ice
She's a hemophiliac with a dying battery life
Candy-colored fingers and Schadenfreude eyes
Thinking airbrushed thoughts with the logo on her mind

It's so frightful and I'm feeling it
Every single fucking day
It's time to party
It's time to party (Woo)

And the world you created in your image is golden

[Verse 1: Bashy]
Ayy, look, yo, no castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
And mommy ain't said ""Honey, I shrunk the kids"" yet
I ain't Jesus, but I'm walking on water
There's no bombs here, there's no war, 'cause
I can break out of jail with a lighter
So is there any point in making laws, blud?
This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore
No rain, condoms, it poured
And up the road, you'd never guess who I saw!

[Verse 2: Kano]
Uh, uh, uh, it's K-A
Look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym (Yeah)
Honey, I'm home, this is where I wanna live (Yeah)
Just found it like Nemo on the D-low
I don't know if it's greener, but it's green, though
On the other side of the fence, bye to the ends
Look, no feds, no stress, no rent
No superficial shit, this real flow
Where the women look hot, but the beach cold
And the speech goes like, ""Hi, little lady
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby?""
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy
Swagger on a hundred degrees, no eighty
Look, if Heaven had a VIP
Uh, this is it, white sand, blue sea
But I don't know who they are
And I'm damn sure they don't know me
But I come in peace

Spinning around the world at night
Spin round in black and white
Spinning around until the sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

[Verse 1: 2-D]
I think I've fallen onto silken thread, my head is spinning
Suspended in a twilight web that keeps on giving
The looping dervish in the lodge is lost within the ringing
Far away, I can hear the sound of someone out there singing
I'm speeding through the forest, strange echoes of Belarus
Where presidents pin badges on disconnected youths
What will you be dreaming of? No horseplay, no diving
Cutting grass with scissors, whilst the great leaders reclining
In the golden hallways where we spin, the faithful will be silent

[Interlude: 2-D]
Existing or not
At the same time
Spinning

Gorillaz,Garage Palace,"35 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiGarage Palace Lyrics[Intro: Little Simz]
Oh, palace flows
Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
When the light shines through it I feel more exposed
Will it ever change here? We'll just never know
Stimulation, I'm in need of
See the time is of the essence and this clock doesn't own a home
Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
When the light shines through I feel more exposed

[Verse 1: Little Simz]
In tune, with myself on it, my mind is my weakness
With your strength, you might surprise yourself
Never deny yourself, I live in the space is my thesis
I know you need this, I know you need this
I'm prone to run out of pieces
That might connect to something bigger
All in your mind, could follow me, you should consider
Look at the time, I'm probably later than ever
""What did you find?"" Well come in here, and lit it with pressure
I look to the heavens and I saw open gates
I walked up and then I paused
What the fuck did you do this for?
Wish me luck when that midnight falls
Memories of a past life
Can this be? This is our time, can this be? This is our time
Come on
You might also like[Verse 2: Little Simz]
In stillness, known to the world, do you feel this?
Trapped in my mind, hope I can find solitude
When connecting all of these pieces
I know you need this, I know you need this
I fold and unleash the beast
Unknown is what I would be
If my whole purpose here wasn't to speak
Now look at the time, I know that I am early today
What did you find when giving up and running away?
I gazed to the stars and this view can't be shared
When there are no other eyes in this room
Mean the words when you sing your tune
Free as a bird when I intake fumes
Memories of this past life
Can this be? This is our time, can this be? This is our time
Come on20Embed",oh palace flows rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop when the light shines through it i feel more exposed will it ever change here well just never know stimulation im in need of see the time is of the essence and this clock doesnt own a home rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop when the light shines through i feel more exposed  in tune with myself on it my mind is my weakness with your strength you might surprise yourself never deny yourself i live in the space is my thesis i know you need this i know you need this im prone to run out of pieces that might connect to something bigger all in your mind could follow me you should consider look at the time im probably later than ever what did you find well come in here and lit it with pressure i look to the heavens and i saw open gates i walked up and then i paused what the fuck did you do this for wish me luck when that midnight falls memories of a past life can this be this is our time can this be this is our time come on you might also like in stillness known to the world do you feel this trapped in my mind hope i can find solitude when connecting all of these pieces i know you need this i know you need this i fold and unleash the beast unknown is what i would be if my whole purpose here wasnt to speak now look at the time i know that i am early today what did you find when giving up and running away i gazed to the stars and this view cant be shared when there are no other eyes in this room mean the words when you sing your tune free as a bird when i intake fumes memories of this past life can this be this is our time can this be this is our time come on
Gorillaz,Hong Kong,"57 ContributorsHong Kong LyricsLord hear me now
Junk boats and English boys
Crashing out in super marts
Electric fences and guns
You swallow me
I'm a pill on your tongue
Here on the nineteenth floor
The neon lights make me calm
And late in a star's life
It begins to explode
And all the people in a dream
Wait for the machine
To pick the shit up, leave it clean
Kid, hang over here
What you learning in school?
Is the rise of an Eastern sun
Gonna be good for everyone?
The radio station disappears
Music turning to thin air
The DJ was the last to leave
She had well conditioned hair
Was beautiful, but nothing really was there

[Chorus: Skepta]
Yeah, wah gwan, brudda?
Time to hustle for the money, give a change to your mother
Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover
Better look sharp, now your face on the cover
Like a chameleon, see you change in your color
Crabs in the barrel, wanna hate on each other
Saw my life gets better, whatever the weather
I dance in the rain and I bathe in summer

[Verse 1: Skepta]
It's the black Corleone in a button-up shirt
Before we take off you better buckle up first
Fresher than the President, psychedelics got me in my element
All negativity, that's irrelevant
Amber Leaf or ganja leaf, I backstrap when I wrap the sheets
Now I feel to go for a drive, so I grab my keys
Shades on, roof down, tryna catch a breeze
Ride around the hood, got the devil in my ear
Can you smell that? Smells like jealousy in the air
Dunno who they're tryna scare
Looked at the man in the mirror, that's the only enemy that I fear
A zombie knows who to frighten
Just know I love the action, but I move in silence
And, right now I'm just takin' what's mine
Till Elizabeth returns the diamond

I hope you're ready for the truth that you're gonna discover
Always gonna be a Judas at the last supper
Stay woke, it's a rocky road on the come-up

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Take the shots like Scorsese
More money, more problems and more ladies
Everyday somebody dies, still, mothers give birth to more babies
The Earth spins, the world gets more crazy
You gotta have a suit for the christening
A suit for the wedding and a suit for the court case
Probably wear the same suit to the funeral
Tryna see the bigger picture, man, it's bigger than the portrait
Bigger than me, no, you can't fight off your demons with vitamin C
Have to open your mind, use your vision and see
Keep your eyes on the prize so vigilantly
Love how you live, remember the world full of expensive shit
Can't forget the poor 'cause you're friends with the rich
Stay true to the bone, I ain't ever gonna switch
[Chorus: Skepta]
Yeah, yeah-yeah, wah gwan, brudda?

Change them sheets, you got stains on the cover

Better check the camera, you don't wanna get stuck up
You listen close, you can hear death around the corner
One wrong move and we're all gonna suffer

I landed on the silver lake
Washed up and feeling blue
Heard the sound of footsteps
Drifting softly to the moon
Looking for clear water
I had to take control
Out there in the wilderness
Another bullet hole

[Pre-Chorus]
Playing it all for gods
Yesterday

There's a beauty on the road
Every day, I look out on the bus
Silver lining's getting lost

[Verse 2]
Floated out into the woods
To hear the old elk call
Touched a rainbow with my hands
I'm dry, I got 'em all
""Ride on,"" said the king of cool
You've got nothing to lose
Tinseltown is down the road
It's the bullet or the noose

Make it up myself, I'll never
Always told my thoughts aloud
Then another day I shut up

Bound to be gone
Damned a loser

Cause everybody said to shut up

[Verse 2: Kano]
Two-steppin' while I move reckless
New settings, booze and nudes pending
Loose evidence and news trending, effortlessly truth bending
Who's treacherous? Searching for feelings of a new friendship
There's but a few endings, everyone's a winner 'til you lose bredrin
Hold-tight when we used to hold tight
Levitate to Most High and fuck up the whole skyline
Bright lights, I hope that feeling can replenish
Regretful, 'cause if I let you left me then I'll be rush rouletting
With a whole full clip in - pow, cashmere drippage now
And memories, lift me up, but still a man's tears dripping down
Onto these photographs of what we used to be
But over time, that puddle turns into a sea
When I observed you cry a stream
I was just surfing on your grief
The hurt I can't delete, just come to terms with who is me
But who are we? These mirrors don't reflect perfection
Just put on your crep selection, come on two-step to heaven with me

Winter lasted for ages
Trouble don't last always
Brand new life, turn the page
Be alright, be okay

You tried to kill me, created a monster
You tried to end me, but fate said ""No, no""
Know why they envy, I got it, it's in me
Been so long since I had new faith
Been so long since I changed my ways
Been so long since I been okay
I met a lady on the side of the road
And her eyes were a story that had never been told
About a life that was lived on hope
And the truth of the inner light that we all hold
She said ""Baby, I can hear my train coming
I'll leave with something before I go
Listen child, don't you ever waste time tryna dim nobody shine
Better water your own""

""Yo. Yo. Yo.""
Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted
I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed
My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics
I'm a lyrical misfit with the sadistic characteristics
I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath
And if a boy wanna phi test, then I be stampin' upon his chest
Done makin' a mess - Not a man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'
And I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human
I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out
And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout
That's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
And I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page
I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flintstone
Get Dino to tear your Moschinos and then force you to limp home

[Life]
I'mma take off like a jet pack with the get back, rather step back
I'mma make the crowd react and nod they heads until they neck snap
I can flip raps while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac
And leave your head in a spin like starin' at turn table skid mats
I'm a concrete lion, big cat - this is real talk, not big-chat
Did ya get that, cause I ain't no small timer - I rhyme on big tracks
Now fell the vibes I create, this heavy weight, I'm about to detonate
And demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate
To the top of my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin'
Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins
My style is totally buckwild and most definitely happenin'
To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in
To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'
I'm dabblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak
Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop through concrete
Concrete, concrete, concrete!
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha!

Gorillaz,Stop the Dams,"38 ContributorsStop the Dams Lyrics[Verse 1: 2D]
When you're smoking tin foil in the morning
It's gonna be a cold day
When you're keeping everything inside you
It can only hurt you

[Chorus 1: 2D]
Unrelated sounds
The sun will shine again
You hold it in your hands

[Verse 2: 2D]
This land is a young land, let it stay that way
Its pollution only turns you into
Something you don't want to see in the water
A reflection of them that you receive

[Chorus 2: 2D]
You don't own the sun
And the sun won't shine again
So maybe you're all in love
With aluminium

[Interlude: Ghostigital]
The cling and a clang is the metal in my head when I walk
I hear a sort of, this tinging noise
""Cling clang"" The cling clang
So many things happen while walking
The metal in my head clangs and clings as I walk
Freaks my balance out
So the natural thought is just clogged up, totally clogged up
So we need to unplug these dams and make the natural flow
It sort of freaks me out
We need to unplug the dams
You cannot stop the natural flow of thought with a cling and a clang

I been searchin', lookin' for a permanent reason
Out of sync with the seasons, not sure what I believe in
And a burden, why is bein' loved so appealin'?
Can't conform, I'm alone
We're all just lost without meanin' (Jimmy, Jimmy)
Just a boy from the West, I'm born and bred
We coulda been rich, was poor instead
My evenings are blue, all my mornings red
I had to make scores from gents (Jimmy, Jimmy)
I salute all my local fiends
They're smilin', locked in a smoker's dream
Kept an ace like a poker team (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Just a teen sellin' coke to fiends (Jimmy, Jimmy)
I took remedy, young ones I love
Got the money, I got stuck inside of my mind
Quick solutions was all I could find
I was earnin', but losin' my time (Jimmy, Jimmy)
Portobello, I'm sippin' on wine
With a beautiful Notting Hill mother of five
Mental muscle, the strong will survive
That's why I drink white rum on the Manchester Drive

It's a cracked screen world
Where white blooms above the city (I'm sorry)
Catch sunrise and the freeway glows
Perfumed with palo santo (Here's what I found)
Early flights touch down (I didn't get that, could you try again)

Every day, the Tired Influencer (I didn't get that, could you try again)
You're sleeping deep, waiting for an answer (Here's what I found)
Gotta press on brown eyes
I always keep you close beside me
Million dreams (Here's what I found)
'Cause that's the way it's meant to be

[Verse 1: GoldLink & 2-D]
I've been losing everything, yeah
I can't keep a fucking thing, yeah
Do the money, do the fame
It seems like that controls this thing
Guess my head just left the building
Like out the window, missed the ceiling
I cannot explain this feeling
I never learned to speak a zillion
Now I'm stuck, my body left me bleedin' (Severed head)
Roll the train, it's passing fast, it's speeding outside
My body gone, don't need the soul, ey
Just take another breathe or so, ey
Found on my torso
I mean my neck go, but where did my heart go?
I mean my leg go, but where did my mind go?
I guess I only gotta go where the body goes
Geronimo (Stay a little longer)

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Paradise has mountains that take a lifetime
To climb in dreams, I fly above them
I'm haunted by what I saw last night
On angelic highways, waiting in the darkness
I'm on a speeding train (Severed head)
I stick my head out of the carriage window (Severed head)
My cheeks inflate, my eyes become watery (Severed head)
Whoosh, my head is severed (Severed head)
Will you stay a little longer?

What exactly did the doctor say?
I've been grinding teeth awake in bed
And my aching head, how could love suddenly be dead?
We could swallow bread, our hunger is not easily fed
I've been waiting for sleep to come
I've been breathing through these aching lungs
I keep waking up, this is worse than ever breaking up
If your time is up, how much more before mine is up?

[Verso 1: MC Bin Laden]
Quando eu era mais novo me diziam que eu não batia muito bem da minha mente
Me chama de louco ou de delinquente
Mas é o flow que te deixa inconsciente
Toma hit, de repente
Faz o drink, brinda com a gente
E os moleque tá vivendo uma vida consequente
Viajando pro fundo do futuro subconsciente
Foi por causa dela que eu entrei na cena
Foi por ela mesmo que eu saí da cena
Se eu tô em silêncio, quem ama é o sistema
E sabe que eu sou moleque-problema, vai
Toma lá, toma cá, tenta vim pra trocar
Se eu tiver sonhando, não precisa me acordar
Tô vendo meu passado no presente
E o presente no futuro, e o futuro pisando no ar
O que tinha no meu copo? Eu tô querendo saber
Elas quer o meu corpo e eu querendo prazer
Tô em todo lugar, não dá pra controlar

Gorillaz,The Sounder,"28 ContributorsThe Sounder Lyrics[Verse 1: Life]
You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini
Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a genie
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B
Cause this one's for your radios over, do you receive me?
Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya
We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his manger
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls
We've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol
See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo

[Chorus: 2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude
It's the reason to deliver
And they called onto me
Says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies
I guess the kids don't live or die

Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it
So people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to refuse it
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy-ardy
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the Mardi-Gradi
We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so profound
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the underground
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your course
Cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so appealing
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol
I know you're hearin' me cause my voice is clearer than crystal
The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin'
Makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm chosen
To rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for

[Chorus: 2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude
It's the reason to deliver
And they called onto me
Says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies
I guess the kids don't live or die
[Verse 3: Life & Si Phili]
Let Gorillaz be your guiding light and your shining star
Whether you be home alone or drivin' in your car
Don't matter who ya are, whether you be near or far
You'll be feelin' entertained be our music repertoire
See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and resevoirs
Cause Gorillaz, we be out of this world like men of Mars
We rap stars with supernatural spars
We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours
So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down
Cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round
From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound
On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat
It's like that when we write raps
We're not from the Empire but we still Strike Back!

Abandon your wars
The sky and thunder and lightning and rain are innocent

But I'm not really caring 'cause I'm dancing on the pavement
Oh, say, can you see?
The sky and thunder and lightning and heaven's open for us

Are you ever really lost?
You cutting cardboard
Watchers waiting, we had names
We had suspects, but a boxset caught your eye
And I was forgotten, I was forgotten

Howling on the sound of swim

It would take a boat

Just take a shaker, make it mean

Sometimes it feels like I ain't met you, it feels like it's déjà vu (Déjà vu)

Send the sentiment, taste the destruction
Earth-level angles folded and tucked in
Your four corners parade in seduction
Pretty veneer boys, step to the rear
I'ma play the chairman and step to the chair
It’s the darling of it all, carving on the wall
Tag the A train to Altamira
Life is intoxicating, I need a beer
Witness the master, I see got the hammer phone cocked
The dawn ain't stoppin', so the rockin’ don't stop
Rain hasn't fallen, so the farmers won't crop
The price of fame will not drop
Ricochet, baby, never the bullseye
Could play the sheep, but beware of the wolf's eye
Hypnotized by the crocodile's smiles
The exchange is brief, but watch for the teeth

[Chorus: Dawn Penn]
Send them healing
They need it, talk
To look at things
Stay blessed, talk
Time of mindfulness
Prior to making changes

Gorillaz,The Book of Noodle,"2 ContributorsThe Book of Noodle LyricsDays after the attack on Plastic Beach, Noodle awoke in a strange Japanese village that smelled of fish. It was a fishing village. She'd been nursed back to health by an old pearl diver named Chiyoko, so to repay her kindness, Noodle took a job as her apprentice.

She was a natural (having shared a tour bus with Murdoc, she was really good at holding her breath). But one day, deep beneath the waves, Noodle prized open a pearl shell of unearthly size, accidentally releasing an ancient hell demon. It scarpered, ready to party like it's 1499.

Noodle learned that this was Maazu, a shapeshifting devil of unimaginable evil, that could take human form. It had to be destroyed. To do so, she must remove its head from its body. Or the other way around.

But finding a shapeshifter is like looking for a beard at an Arcade Fire concert. For years, Noodle pursued Maazu across Japan, from the heights of Mt Fuji to the deepest, darkest forests. Finally, she tracked Maazu to Tokyo, where it had risen to the top of the criminal underworld.

Disguising herself as a geisha, Noodle infiltrated its debauched headquarters, The Demon's Lodge. And there, while Maazu was distracted by a heated bout of 'Drink While You Think', she lopped off its head. His earthly existence was over. And the carpet was ruined.
Escaping Mazuu's Sumo bodyguards, Noodle packed herself into a FedEx crate with dried fish, bottled water and a copy of Moby Dick - if she was ever to finish Melville's onerous classic, it was now.

Gorillaz,The Book of 2D,"4 ContributorsThe Book of 2D LyricsDuring the pirate attack on Plastic Beach, 2D hid in his underwater quarters. Unwittingly he'd made himself prey to a far fiercer foe: a great white whale known as Massive Dick (weirdly, no relation to Moby). The blubbery beast swallowed 2D in one bite, and swam into the deep.

But a lifetime spent eating ocean garbage – and now 2D – took its toll on Massive, and he died. His carcass washed up on a desert island, where 2D was finally free... to die of starvation, due to a total lack of survival skills. Unable even to catch crabs (which was more Murdoc's forte), 2D had no option but to eat his former host. Rancid whale blubber for breakfast, lunch and dinner. With a side of sand.

Several months later, 2D spotted a plane flying along the coast. Moved to tears by this beacon of hope, he set off in its direction. Twenty-three minutes later he was in the middle of a full-scale beach rave. It turns 2D wasn't marooned at all. He had in fact landed on Guadalupe, off the Mexican coast. 2D joined the beach party, ate some strange-tasting brownies, and came third in the wet T-shirt contest.

Gorillaz,Hip Albatross,"22 ContributorsHip Albatross Lyrics[Announcement]
Every dead body that is not exterminated becomes one of them. It gets up and kills! The people it kills get up and kill!

[Sample from ""Dawn of the Dead""]
""Why is it?""

""Because they still believe there´s respect.""

""Hello Captain.""

[Simultaneously with Verse 1]
""The normal question, the first question is always; are these cannibals? No, they are not cannibals. Cannibalism in the true sense of the word implies an interspecies activity. These creatures cannot be considered human. They prey on humans. They do not prey on each other! That's the difference. They attack and they feed only on warm human flesh.""

Gorillaz,California and the Slipping of the Sun,"15 ContributorsCalifornia and the Slipping of the Sun Lyrics[Intro]
If you have any checked bags, they will be brought to the front of the station
To get to the front, walk down to the south end of the platform and cross left at the crosswalk
That'll put you right in front of the depot
Look for a sign that says ""baggage claim""
You should have your claim check handy to show the clerk
Give them a few minutes to get your bags to the front
If anyone is in need of a ride to the front of the station
Red Cap service will be provided on the platform
We do have one group that is going to go first
If you do need Red Cap service to arrive at the front
They will come back and pick you up on the platform and take you to the front of the station
Taxi cabs are located on the center boulevard in front of the depot

[Verse]

Oh, ocean now, I come again before you
Rode along with you
In the slipping of the sun
Sun on dreamers
Repeat the faithful once again
Like water on the mountains, that
It's the slipping of the sun

Kids don't fight with knives anymore

They fight with guns!
Kids have got guns!
(Turning us into monsters)
It's all desire
It's all desire...

Well it's fine
You know, the son was young
And then he started 'grow up faster
Parents wondered what went wrong
And then he turned into a little monster!

Because son was a little scalawag-wag-wagger
Can't see much more
If a lesson I guess
I'd hold it straight away
Back to the point
Give him three Coca-Colas
He'll run away
Write up the walls and down
The little dirty scalawag of a monster!

So mama, please let us out on the town
We want to drink, we want to fight
We want it all night
We're going to smash up your neighbor's car
If you don't let us out that door!
It's fine and dandy
I'll just climb out me window, leave y'all!
See you later, never liked you anyway!
I swear I'm adopted!
Stop it!

But my mind's sharper than anybody's!
And dad's just a drink drink drunker
And I'm back to the point of the matter!
I'm still here!
And I'm still walking out!
I'll see you later (Calm down, don't kill me now!)
I'm going to get a job
Because I'm leaving school
Because I can't get at Clara Clough!

Heavy heart
Leaving me so low
See you later!

Don't worry mama

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine, in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
[Verse 1: Del]
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless to know the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Psychic among those, possess you with one go

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Del]
The essence, the basics, without it you make it
Allow me to make this, childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sprouting tree, every child o' peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (that's right)
From this fucking enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles, but the percussion he provides
With me as a guide, y'all can see me now cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner, so I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this

I’m a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah that’s the Crip side
Ain’t no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ

I'm S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can’t fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See I specialize in making all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don’t change the dizzle, turn it up a little

Gorillaz,The Book of Murdoc,"4 ContributorsThe Book of Murdoc LyricsThe last anyone heard of Mudoc Niccals, he was living on Plastic Beach, an island in the South Pacific formed entirely from rubbish.

All was well, until the day Murdoc's tropical ghetto was raided by pirates. (Not the eye-patch king - those modern-day ones with machine guns and no sense of flair). Murdoc decided that evacuation was the bravest option, and fled heroically in a rusty brown submarine.

With only a crate of Psycho Jerry's Rum for sustenance and Cyborg Noodle for company, Murdoc navigated his way through the slimy Octopuses Garden. Cyborg Noodle proved the perfect shipmate for Murdoc: she didn't speak, she didn't judge, and she had absolutely no sense of smell.

Finally, when the booze ran out, Murdoc made to the surface and popped the hatch, releasing the rum-soaked air of the submersible like a kraken's guff. As he emptied his dangerously enlarged bladder, a giant shadow loomed over him. Two, if you count the ever-present memory of his disappointed father. But the other shadow was a ship: the Battleship Ringo, owned by music industry giant EMI.
Before it was chopped up and sold like a prize pig, EMI had sent a fleet of ships to search the globe for Murdoc. At last, they had him. The Gorillaz star was captured, slapped about a bit, and taken to a secret prison on London.

'Dungeon Abbey', beneath Abbey Road Studios, was built to detain the label's ABCs (Artists in Breach of Contract). For three years it served as Murdoc's home, until one day, he was offered a deal by Entertainment Internal Affairs. Like an unloved goldfish, the music industry was in dire need of Murdoc's legendary song-writing prowess. In exchange for his release (and a carton of Lucky Lungs cigarettes), Murdoc agreed to write a new Gorillaz album and moved immediately to a new studio home in West London.Embed",all was well until the day murdocs tropical ghetto was raided by pirates. not the eye patch king those modern day ones with machine guns and no sense of flair . murdoc decided that evacuation was the bravest option and fled heroically in a rusty brown submarine. with only a crate of psycho jerrys rum for sustenance and cyborg noodle for company murdoc navigated his way through the slimy octopuses garden. cyborg noodle proved the perfect shipmate for murdoc: she didnt speak she didnt judge and she had absolutely no sense of smell. finally when the booze ran out murdoc made to the surface and popped the hatch releasing the rum soaked air of the submersible like a krakens guff. as he emptied his dangerously enlarged bladder a giant shadow loomed over him. two if you count the ever present memory of his disappointed father. but the other shadow was a ship: the battleship ringo owned by music industry giant emi. before it was chopped up and sold like a prize pig emi had sent a fleet of ships to search the globe for murdoc. at last they had him. the gorillaz star was captured slapped about a bit and taken to a secret prison on london. dungeon abbey beneath abbey road studios was built to detain the labels abcs artists in breach of contract . for three years it served as murdocs home until one day he was offered a deal by entertainment internal affairs. like an unloved goldfish the music industry was in dire need of murdocs legendary song writing prowess. in exchange for his release and a carton of lucky lungs cigarettes  murdoc agreed to write a new gorillaz album and moved immediately to a new studio home in west london.

Finally someone let me out of my bag
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm in a bag
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm in a bag
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all in a bag
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different bags
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' in a bag too
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe
Spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're in a bag
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless
To you because I put you in a bag

Without did you make it
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature

You have it or you don't that's a bag
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see in a bag
I see destruction and demise
Corruption in disguise
From this bag enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me in a bag
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so baaaaaag remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is in a bag
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in a bag

Shit my granddad was built like a half a whale
We rip through cell doors we don't ask for bail
Happy Gilmore Gorilla whooping ass for real
Beat you down till they lock you for a night in jail
Then I'm back on purple hills so I can jack the jill
They pass the wheel I'm drunk tipsy punk
My sweat become whisky I'm looking for Lewinsky
So I can get head, done, get off me girl
I'm crooked like white folks dancin' offbeat

At the bar posing with my Sean Combs brim
On the broad to get her bra open
See a Gorilla take it they don't ask
I'm pissed on the boss desk when he laid on cash

[Verse 1: Trugoy the Dove]
Drums'll fall heavy like anvil weight
Higher than your sky scape goat cheese
Order, order, please
Run, Joe, run, there are criminals behind you
Side-winders and snakes your moves define you
Remind you:
How I wish my brother Del was here
Catalogue originals, the expert's clear
Sheared legs of lamb your whole style's ham
We are tons and tons and you are just a gram
In the hand of irrelevance, banned from the benefits
Cancellin' your visa
Pushing 'til you lean like the Pisa
These-za, 30 below freeze-za
Caesar got stabbed cause he was a biatch
Gia
Piano key-za, selecta touch the ivory
I see it in black and white
It's an easy ideology
We sigh, and sweat, and tear, save the blood for valentine
Tell me how you're feelin' at the end of the rhyme

They say I have no meaning, no purpose
So why do I exist?
I purchase me some bracelets to protect my wrists
I hid that rope, I flushed those pills
All those opposing me cause they can't get the deals
I catch them in a pickle trying to steal home plate
When I got the home field advantage
Don't think they can manage
Stop this shine, cross this line
You will find it didn't have to go there
Leading out to nowhere
Faster than a bullet train
I got me a Lois Lane, I'm feeling like I'm Superman
Here in the Yucatan
I yell it from the studio, loud and clear
Howl in here
Explosion, damage, corrosion
It's what remains in your theory
I'm in this emissary
'Til the end of the love letter
We'll go get her
""Can't"" has no place in my vocabulary
Why you even doubt it?
It wasn't necessary

Gorillaz,The Book of Russel,"3 ContributorsThe Book of Russel LyricsRussel Hobbs had always put on weight easily, so when he grew sixty times in size swimming to Plastic Beach, he thought it might be his thyroid. Noodle, riding on his back the whole way, guessed it was more likely the six tons of polluted shrimp he'd swallowed en route.

Russel had found Murdoc, but like a circumcision ceremony their reunion was cruelly cut short. Pirates attacked from all sides, so Russell cradled Noodle inside his giant mouth and swam away.

Their trouble, however, was just beginning. Somewhere off the coast of Japan, Russel was mistaken for a whale and harpooned. He managed to wriggle free, but in the fracas Noodle was swept away into the blood-red waters.

Wounded and delirious, Russel struggled on through the ocean, feebly humming the power ballad All By Myself  until he lost consciousness. Eventually, he drifted into the warm waters of the Yellow Sea and washed up on a North Korean beach.

Giant Russel was carted to Pyongyang, where he was exhibited like a modern day Gulliver. The regime's Glorious Leader declared that he'd captured Pulgasari, the legendary North Korean Godzilla. Russel became the country's biggest attraction, and 'I survived Pulgasari' t-shirts became the nation's fastest selling fashion item. Or would have done if people were allowed to sell anything other than manure and tanks.

In time, the North's meagre food rations caused Russel to shrink back to normal size. Realising Russel was just a man, the Glorious Leader proclaimed that he'd personally defeated Pulgasari, and Russel was released. He was given a signed pressing of Kim Sings Sinatra, and sent back to England, where he wandered the streets of London, until musician and Gorillaz collaborator Jeff Wootton let him crash on his futon.

A few days later, Jeff's phone rang - it was Murdoc. Without delay, Russel moved into Murdoc's new West London home.

The band was getting back together.Embed",russel had found murdoc but like a circumcision ceremony their reunion was cruelly cut short. pirates attacked from all sides so russell cradled noodle inside his giant mouth and swam away. their trouble however was just beginning. somewhere off the coast of japan russel was mistaken for a whale and harpooned. he managed to wriggle free but in the fracas noodle was swept away into the blood red waters. wounded and delirious russel struggled on through the ocean feebly humming the power ballad all by myself until he lost consciousness. eventually he drifted into the warm waters of the yellow sea and washed up on a north korean beach. giant russel was carted to pyongyang where he was exhibited like a modern day gulliver. the regimes glorious leader declared that hed captured pulgasari the legendary north korean godzilla. russel became the countrys biggest attraction and i survived pulgasari t shirts became the nations fastest selling fashion item. or would have done if people were allowed to sell anything other than manure and tanks. in time the norths meagre food rations caused russel to shrink back to normal size. realising russel was just a man the glorious leader proclaimed that hed personally defeated pulgasari and russel was released. he was given a signed pressing of kim sings sinatra and sent back to england where he wandered the streets of london until musician and gorillaz collaborator jeff wootton let him crash on his futon. a few days later jeffs phone rang it was murdoc. without delay russel moved into murdocs new west london home. the band was getting back together.

Keeping my groove on

Caught up in the conflict

Yo. Yo
Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted
I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed
My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics
I'm a lyrical misfit with the sadistic characteristics
I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath
And if a boy wanna fi test, then I be stampin' upon his chest
Done makin' a mess - not a man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'
And I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human
I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out
And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout
That's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
And I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page
I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flinstone
Get Dino to tear your Moschinos and then force you to limp home

I'm a concrete lion, big cat - this is real talk, not big-chat
Did ya get that, cause I ain't no small timer - I rhyme on big tracks
Now fell the vibes I create, this heavy weight, I'm about to detonate
And demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate
To the top of my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin'
Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins
My style is totally buckwild and most definitely happenin'
To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in
To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'

Stop, 'cause you're killing me
You brought me back and you made me feel free
Rowdy waves and your energy
You pulled me fragile from the wreckage
I got so lost here
Machine-assisted, I disappear
Into a dream, you don't wanna hear
How I got caught up in nowhere again

Through the infinite pages, I've scrawled out
Searching for a new world
That waits on the sunrise

A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing, 'cause I don't get sleep, no

They believed that a great reckoning was coming
A time when all the lies, and the shit, and the garbage
Piled up so high, a giant, writhing, supercharged mass would
Rise into the clouds, casting everything in shadow
But not all will be lost in the dark, for righteous are the lambs
Who nourish this great corruption
Feeding it more lies and malicious code, infecting it yet further
Until critical overload is reached, when all shall be wiped clean
And the tyranny of the algorithm shall be no more
And afterward, the collective of the new dawn will see clearly
For the first time, and learn the One True Story
A story which ends at the beginning of a new reality
When, as one being, we shall be born anew and rise again

Tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
Tell me that I won't die at the hands of the police
Promise me I won't outlive my nephew and my niece
Promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
Tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that I teach
Tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
But until then, I keep my piece in arm's reach

When it comes to the Gorillaz we got stars in stacks
From the mental to the physical, we're tough and very lyrical
We shine, like the sun performing many miracles

We combine the design music that be standing on the frontline
The rough neck showing up our respect
Live and direct, we connect with a positive intellect

The maddest and baddest with the music that's masterminded
Dazzling and rhyming with the music that's be defining

Shining, me and the rest of Gorillaz stars
Our songs be lastin' past the existency of the last star

Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunеs?
Picture you getting down in a picture tubе
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?

Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype s***

Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this f*****' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (F*** 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherf****** remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)

No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner, so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

Here is our tree
That primitively grows
And when you go to bed
Scarecrows from the far east
Come to eat
Its tender fruits
And I thought the best way to protect our tree
Is by building walls
Walls like unicorns
In full glory
And galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho
But glad then my friend

Are now for the starving

I've seen their worlds inside my head
They connect with the fall of man
They breathe you in and dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between when the tiding is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is an outer heart and the space has been broken

But he calls himself in the power of your name
You got me turned onto you
And it might be me and might be you
Calling in the outside

Is it far away in the glitter freeze?
Or in our eyes every time they meet
It's in the light of the plasma screens
We keep switched on all through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for her
She is a coincident, in a wrong line
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart and the space has been broken

It's broken

The flow is toe in, precision as an afro trim
All big letters but isn't no acronym
Smack the thin grin off a chin for crack smoking
DDT the first bar, leave the track back broken
Chrome grown men doing business with Anglo-Sax and them
Lacking swing so that banjo's so relaxing
As the wax spin, hacking axes in the wind
Pretend it's just a pen, see if we can pencil 'em in
Tense, mention men of honour fenced in
Census is tens, the wheels fall off then it's the end
Don't get keelhauled in
Villain always been, feel real genuine ballskin
Not queuing at the bar
Catch me at the table
Treacle walks past
Sweeter than maple
Piercing in her navel
Left school long time ago but got class, everything's tasteful

Say, say, my playmate
Won't you lay hands on me?
Mirror my malady?
Transfer my tragedy?
Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gotta bust that box, gotta gut that fish (My mind's aflame)
We could jet in a stolen car
But I bet we wouldn't get too far
Before the transformation takes
And blood lust tanks and crave gets slaked

[Chorus]
My mind has changed my body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame, my body's strained, but, God, I like it
My mind has changed my body's frame, but, God, I like it
My heart's aflame, my body's strained, but, God, I like it

Charge me your day rate
I'll turn you out in kind

If ever there were a lucky kind

Let me lay waste to thee
Burned down their hanging trees

There's a curse comes with a kiss
The bite that binds the gift that gives (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Now that we got gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood (We're howling forever, oh, oh)
Tell your grandma and your mama too

Congratulations on the mess you made of things
I'm trying to reconstruct the air and all that brings
And oxidation is the compromise you own
But this is beginning to feel like the dog wants a bone, say

Your methods dot the disconnect from all your creeds
And fortune strives to fill the vacuum that it feeds

This is beginning to feel like the long winded blues of the never
This is beginning to feel like it's curling up slowly and finding a throat to choke
This is beginning to feel like the long winded blues of the never
Barely controlled locomotive consuming the picture and blowing the crows to smoke
This is beginning to feel like the long winded blues of the never
Static explosion devoted to crushing the broken and shoving their souls to ghost
Eternalized, objectified
You set your sights so high
But this is beginning to feel like the bolt busted loose from the lever

Forever cashed out to no more

But my heart's still a marble
In an empty jelly jar
Someday suppose that my
Curious nervousness
Spills into prescience

Making maps out of your dreams
But will psychic ability
Clinch the nativity?
Or simply diminish that flinch?

TV on the Radio,I Was a Lover,"12 ContributorsI Was a Lover LyricsI was a lover before this war
Held up in a luxury suite, behind a well-barricaded door
Now that I've cleaned up, gone legit
I can see clearly, round hole
Round hole, square peg don't fit

I'm locked in my bedroom, so send back the clowns
My clone wears a brown shirt
And I seduce him when there's no one around
Mano y mano on a bed of nails
Bring it on like a storm
'Til I knock the wind out of his sails
And we don't make eye contact when we have run-ins in town
Just a barely polite nod
And nervous stares towards the ground
I once joined a priest class, plastic, inert
Slow-danced with commerce
Like a lens up a skirt
And we liked to party
And we kept it live
And we had a three volume tome of contemporary slang
To keep a handle on all this jive

Ennui unbridled, let's talk to kill the time
How many styles did you cycle through before you were mine?
And it's been a while since we went wild and that's all fine
But we're sleepwalking through this trial
And it's really a crime, it's really a crime, it's really a crime
It's really criminal
You might also likeWe're busy tempting like fate's on the nod
Running on empty, bourbon and God
It's been a while though since we knew the way
And it's been even longer
Since our plastic priest class had a goddamned thing
To say

Into a rest stop for the dead
And did it all in gold and blue and gray

The efforts to allay your dread
In spite of all you knew and said
Were hard to see and harder still to say

A comfort plush all laced in lead
Was sent to quell your sentiment
And keep your trembling sentinel hand at bay

And when a sudden silhouette
Escaped the top side of your bed
I knew you'd never ever be the same

Ah, is it not me
Am I not folded by your touch
The words you spoke, I know too much
It's over now and not enough
Ah, is it not me
The damage you hold inside your blush
The load you towed, you showed it up
It's over now and I'm insane

Wild spirit winds from out your chest
Collides with world and wilderness
It needs a gentle hand to call it home

He's a what? He's a what? He's a newspaper man
And he gets his best ideas from a newspaper stand
From his boots to his pants to his comments and his rants
He knows that any little article will do
Though he expresses some confusion about his part in the plan
And he can't understand that he's not in command
The decisions underwritten by the cash in his hand
Bought a sweater for his weimaraner, too
Now I'm no mad man but that's insanity
Feast before famine and more before family
Goes and shows up with more bowls and more cups
And the riot for the last hot meal erupts
Corrupts his hard drive through the leanest months
Shells out the hard cash for the sickest stunts
On aftershave, on gasoline
He flips the page and turns the scene

[Chorus]
In my mind I'm drowning butterflies
Broken dreams and alibis
That's fine

TV on the Radio,Seeds,"5 ContributorsSeeds Lyrics[Verse 1]
I know you eat your lovers when you sense that something isn't right
I hope that's over and you're letting him go
I always wondered what your gypsy heart would feel like
I got a feeling that you're letting me know
I told your sister that you're all I ever dream of
Your sister told me that I better move slow
And then she told me things I never could've dreamed of
And then she told me things I should not have known

[Chorus 1]
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground
Rain comes down like it always does
This time, I've got seeds on ground

[Interlude 1]
Lay down your liar's tongue, coat of arms, broken charms
And dance with me
Lay down your liar's tongue, coat of arms, broken charms
And dance with me
Lay down your liar's tongue, coat of arms, broken charms
And dance with me

[Verse 2]
I know you've got your reasons when you're keeping your defenses up
It seems to me too much, try letting them go
But hits defeat the misses and we knock each other senseless, love
We come together and we start to move slow
You've got me thinking that you're all I ever need now
I think I love you and it's starting to show
And if you hadn't shown me all the things I never dreamed of
I do not think that I'd be missing you so

Confidence and ignorance approved me
Define my day today
I've tried so hard to shut it down, lock it up
Gently walk away
Appetites and impulses confuse me
Decide my day, today
Now my body says it's over
Shaking hands move to tear my face away
And when the night comes I'm fiending like a pyro
And I know stables my survival
When there's music all around me and I haven't got a single word to say
And then the light shines
It's gleaming like a bottle
And lord knows I tackled it full throttle
May I illuminate the nameless faceless saints of this out and open grace

[Chorus]
Every lover on a mission, shift your known position into the light
Every diamond elemental, you are instrumental to the light
Every sonic evolution, make your contribution to the light
Every lover on a mission, shift your known position to the light

See you moving so inspired

Funny now it's all out
See what only nakedness could hide
Something's got you tongue tied
Like you're barely handling the ride

Sentimental storm clouds
Gathering, let's try pray them down
They've been there the whole time
Following from crib, to crawl to walk, to run, to slow

[Chorus 1]
Live and die for it
Simulating blood baths in bed
Or red, we're wed
And unembarrassed to dare this affair with

No brutalized romance or criticized slow dance
Your head's your head
But still we're not afraid to share
This with careful awareness

Heartbeat sounding
Ricocheting in their cage
Thought I'd lose my balance
With the ground's bounce and sway
And all this violence
And all this goes away
And the vibes that rise like
Fireflies illuminate our play
Some light being
Pulled you up from night's party
Said ""Clap your hands
If you think your soul is free""
And the silence was astounding
'Cept some ""Oh Lord, mercy M-E""s
And oh, you can't stop what's coming up
You're never gonna stop, gonna live it up
And oh, it's gonna drop, gonna fill your cup
And oh, it's gonna drop, gonna fill your cup

Let it kiss your face
Let it sow your skin

With the hunger and the greed
Move your body
You've got all you need
And your arms in the air stir a sea of stars

Clap your hands

Of blossoms that bloomed so fine

Light on good friends and fortune
It's chipped you away inside
And drawn all your blinds
Concealed it all from sight

From the depths I called you, Ma
For your breath and breast so warm and fabled
Your hands reached inside
Grabbed my heart, enlarged, disabled
Hailed for your mercy
An ear that cares
How the blues sound from up there?

[Verse 2]
With my wet hair
I wipe the blood off of your feet
Carry me through these shark infested waters
Well, you spared
Me from slaughter for sure
But these sharks
Are equally in need of a martyr
Oh, kindness shared
Undeserved purest gift, this life you've spared
How the blues sound from up there?

Teeth gnashing
Masticating this dumb tongue
Quiet now, quiet now, hear that supplication
Echo into the void
Been received by no one
Oh, my sweet dear
Cold, alone, poisoning ourselves
Engulfed in our own tears

Faceless fall from this life and ah, if you can't

With the owl high above canyons' mighty walls
Owl said, ""Death's a door that love walks through
In and out, in and out, back and forth, back and forth""

Oh, let it free, that caged on fire thing
Oh, hold its hands, it'll feel like lightning

TV on the Radio,Red Dress,"5 ContributorsRed Dress Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey Jackboot
Fuck your war
Cause I'm fat and in love
And no bombs are falling on me for sure
But I'm scared to death
That I'm living a life not worth dying for
And your plowshare
It's a sword
And its wide arcing swing chops the heads off of many things
Mono crops, laughter roars
Oh high hilarity
Oh multifarity
Oh standard bearer carry me burning home from another tour

[Chorus]
Go ahead put your red dress on
Days of white robes have come and gone
Come and gone
Oh you rivers, oh you waters run
Come bear witness to the Whore of Babylon

[Verse 2]
""Hey slave,"" they called
And we caved
We answered
To a new name
Shout it loud shout it lame
But blackface it
You're such a good dancer
Oh you're a star
You're carnival
Jacaranda petals fall
Mix with the blood of the saints
Shot down in the square
Don't track it in on the soles of your shoes
When you're dragged into the back of this car

Go ahead put your red dress on
Days of white robes have come and gone
Come and gone
Oh you rivers, oh you waters run
Come bear witness to the Whore of Babylon

[Verse 3]
It's a trap
That much is plain
Still, maybe send snapshots
Of all your sweet pain
Playing torturous games
It goes: Lens, light, fame
Read my names on your lips
When the man cracks the whip
And you'll all shake your hips
And you'll all dance to this
Without making a fist
And I know that it sounds mundane
But it's a stone cold shame
And they got you tame
And they got me tame

[Chorus]
So go ahead put your red dress on
Days of white robes come and gone
Come and gone
Oh you rivers, oh you waters run

And we'll go where nobody's gonna know us

I caught a glimpse of professional evil
On the day our poor hearts died
I fell in love with professional evil
On the day you left my side
I’ve seen tons of people looking lost and lethal
And I think we're all the same
So I scale a steeple and I take a leap
But I just can’t keep the stain!

[Chorus]
From my soul
It felt so cold
It’s got to go
Through my soul

Things fall apart in the blink of an eye
Better keep yours open wide
Things fall apart in the blink of an eye

TV on the Radio,Let the Devil In,"10 ContributorsLet the Devil In LyricsBeg the bee's forgiveness as it's falling from your sleeve
Watch its guts pump poison into sting
Watch it reach completeness, see it fall asleep
Legs above fold in eternal dream

Oh, that calls to mind a joke, an off coloring
About these fools blindfolded, drugged, and raped and left laughing
They let the devil in, he brought his pirate friends
They brought a hunger for blood and flesh and bone and skin

So teeth left chattering and tongues flexed to sing
Got dressed up in so many fancy things

Is it a waste of time? Tell me if you mind
Me dipping into useless sentimentality
A rant on how things used to be when this shit was free
I answered my own question, I can hear the crickets yawning
But in the back pocket of a discarded pair of jeans
Is still a priceless ticket to the grandest opening
So when the chariot arrives you'd best enjoy the ride
'Cause when we get to Heaven's gate we're not getting inside

Better beg forgiveness
Better drop to knees
Better find your ticket

In the dark of the night I found
Without my love, my love
These words are not a bit profound
If it's just another cheap line flung

Outside ecstatic love
What did we think we'd find?
Over that broken road
Out past the land mines

[Chorus]
I'm going to keep your heart
I'm going to keep your heart
With the world all falling apart
I'm going to keep your heart

Can I coax it out its shell
Brush the dust off
Get its wings on
In this little bell
We will also feel the singing, oh

Shine on, light of love
On all these bruises and scars
Ruins in every less
But it can't cancel out the stars

If you're the kind who keeps the veil on

When and if to sail on

Seem to have come undone

To arrive ahead of its time
Is the fate of the fish washed up on shore
Do you know that he just won't feel right
Till he's swallowed up by the tide
Thought it might know better
Born into capital lifestyle heights
Got a head full of fever and it feels all right
Cause I shake my bottle and I suck my swill
And I love how I'm living cause I've got my fill
But I can't stop thinking how it's all gone wrong
And the cracks will be obvious before too long
I've abused my position and it cost my friends
And if the world keeps turning I could do it again

[Chorus 1]
What's the matter with your next-door neighbor
I heard he had sex, drugs and danger
But you can kick it with a complete stranger
I think I hear him calling
What's the matter with your next-door neighbor
An act of man, a freak of nature
You've been kicking with a complete stranger
I think I hear him calling now

[Verse 2]
And the time on your hands is a walk in the park
If it don't then I hope you can see in the dark (real hard)
Hail Mary, watch your life unfold
I'm a man on a mission or so I've been told
I can choose my victims, I could shed my skin
And if the world keeps turning I could do it again
But I can't stop thinking that it's all gone wrong
And the truth will be obvious before too long

But you can kick it with a complete stranger
I think I hear him calling

You've been kicking with a complete stranger
I think the curtain's falling down

Now drop yourself
With no concern
On how to breathe
When your mind is burned
On optimistic
On overload
Can you shift the heat back
To when your heart grown cold

Is feathered light
Our source of damage
And with that caged
To the cause of light

Gone optimistic
We're gonna survive

To a greener hideaway
There in peace I found my fun
Till I heard the future say

For want of room
And I'm forgetting to breathe

But the sight of you

Little flightless metal birds
High above in limbless tree
Echoes from their tiny box
Ring out into the atmosphere
Creating beauty inadvertently
It was a technological feat
Wading through the market's waste (This little bird)
We locked eyes, felt our loneliness abate
True desire showed its face, but only momentarily

[Chorus]
Grey cascades in foreign waves
Wash the day away

[Verse 2]
I bought you flowers from the dying woods of Brazil (This little bird)
While the kids burned down the greenhouse pushed the charred frame into the landfill (Put his beak to the word)
We bought new bodies, we bought diamond encrusted guns (So who the hell are you?)
Making out so high in the backseat of a car-bomb under carcinogenic sun

In empty bottles, behind locked doors
You could be the contents of 100 tiny plastic bags
Emptied onto dirty kitchen tables
Oh, late night, late night

You could be love
You could be held so warm
In these arms
In these arms
You could be held aloft
So strong, So strong

You could be invited to invent a new whole language
Devoid of all its current deathly pain and suffering
You could be darkness

Still you could get lost

TV on the Radio,Million Miles,"1 ContributorMillion Miles LyricsHere's to a truth we knew
Non-verbal
No writ no script just light like a whip struck on soul leather
It was a feeling
That I shared with you
It could only be hinted at with metaphor
Crudely drawn clichéd form
But I knew what I knew

You could hear it in her voice
She was over the moon
You could see it when he moved
And danced to the tune of love so true

Now it's over and you're cold
Your story's stale from being told
Know the tale skip to the end
Maybe you're achin' but try it again

Then it goes
A million miles an hour
Think you'll let it take you home
Freeze your golden hour
When you let love break your heart
It pulls [you back] to pieces
As you're weeping through the miracle
After all that we've been through
Thought I heard them say
""I can't believe it isn't gold""
It isn't gold

Sip from soiled lovers' cup
And we'll time the shine that climbs
We'll fall in line in this humble parade

[Leaving lights on] turn them off
We can play the parts of the ones we lost
We'll be wed in warm sweet hell
And we'll lie as we lay

You can see it on her face
That the song's out of tune
You can read it in his gait
As he walked away

Now it's over and we're cold
No more story left to unfold
We read the end again and again
It always goes that way

Then it goes
A million miles an hour
Don't you let love break your heart
Givin' all your power
To a flame that falls apart
Freeze your golden hour
Don't you even let it start
Don't let it start

Vampire life steez, but I’m no Jim Jones
Cold as wind blow, through my window
Can’t sleep tonight, or until the morning
Rub one out or get a bone in, eat some melatonin
Equal parts Dolph Lundgren and a dolphin
Endorphins, Mighty like the Morphin
Power, Rangers, my life’s stranger
Life’s a bitch, but I don’t wanna try to change her
My arms achin’, and my legs too
Look at me sideways, try to behead you
Wanna roll the sun up and smoke it, no jokin’
Bumpin’ rails of the moon like hocus pocus
Slow kid make dough chips
He focused, but dopin’
Colder than the winter get to warmer than the dinner is
Catch me at the crib watchin’ TV on the internet

Arms for the armless, farms for the farmless

[Radio DJ]
You are tuned in to WQED Classical 89.9 on your FM dial. The time is now 3:15. We just heard 'Netti Fretti Con Volante', written in 1899 by the renowned Scotch-Italian composer Shamus Vitilago, preformed by the choir St. Martin-in-the-Field in Minnesota. DJ Bullshit conducting, this was recorded just last year, in Minnesota. Not much is known about Shamus Vitilago; he was well renowned, but mostly for his antics, for his theater. He was a midget, peg-legged drunkard who toured incessantly with the circus, and also had an unparalleled ear for dissonance and atonality. He lead a strange life and suffered an equally strange fate. He was beaten to death by the painter Caravaggio in 1899 after debuting the song we just heard now. The litelul- litera- excuse me... literal translation for which follows as such:

[?]; This whore has rescued me, necrophilia can wait
[?]; My madness explains its need to kill
[?]; Us on her bed, her godless bed, begin our gruesome exchange
[?]; A burning net with wings is what love is

And the chorus of the song, that magnificent sweeping chorus:

[?]; I pull out on the brink of unconsciousness and spackle Gena with my ejaculate

Bold images. Strong, strong images, wonderfully sung. The song was dedicated to Caravaggio and his beautiful new wife, Gena. Classical 89.9, the time is now 3:20.

TV on the Radio,Buffalo Girls,"1 ContributorBuffalo Girls Lyrics[Intro]
It's happening again
The sound erodes my mouth
And now it's mappening again
Demarking territories
Lips are flapping again
Slapping crappy raps
And setting toes tapping again
And asses shaking
(What you sayin'?)

[Chorus]
Buffalo girls, won't you come out tonight?
Buffalo girl
Buffalo girls, won't you come out tonight?

[Verse 1]
Once I said I wouldn't touch your shit with Hitler's dick
But now your body's changed my mind
Because those thighs is thick
Yo, you packed in the back
Like you was hiding twin midgets
Contraband booty shaker
Girl, give me the digits!
""I got a man,"" says you
""I didn't ask,"" says I
""Besides, you mean to tell me
That you're satisfied?""
(Oh no)
""I'm just saying, got three courses
In that backside meal
What does he
Tag it, doggy bag it?
Come on girl, for real!""

[Verse 3]
In the days of Grecian yore
My name was Flavius Maximus
Profusely seducing cooches
In a way deemed blasphemous
""By Jesus, God,"" the nymphs cried
As I induced their juices
A sexual slaughter of all their
Daughters, from Bruce's to Zeus's
My succubus staff
Pure animus arms octopus groping
Copious bounty, melliferous breasts
Clitoris unloose your sluices
And register my radius
All screaming, all screaming
""Save us, Flavius! Save us, Flavius,""
""From what?""
""From the glut of ill lovers
""Sticking like string cheese in a gorge
""Clear-cut nillaput niggas
""Bustin' coconuts then they out the door
""From the glut of mango-wranglers
""Wouldn't know suave if it sucked 'em
""Macho wang-baggers still
""Wouldn't know dick if it fucked 'em
""So save us, Flavius,"" they cried
They cried from two sets of labias
And, oh yes
Stampedo for my torpedo

Woah
(slow times for you?)[x2]
(what's a boy to do?)

[Verse 1]
From my parapet I spy out the corner of my eye
On the street where you walk on by your beauty on the run from me
Come to me, I beckon but I reckon since it's mentally
Not dust to thee, my density can hinder your mobility
So what? another vision fades into the twisted (faded) cityscapes
Like trying to find twin snowflakes looking for another heart to break
Oh, she break me equally I pray to my dead god to send
A sullen siren just to silence my automaton tongue

[Chorus] [x4]
Tell me what to do
So I don't hurt you

[Verse 2]
He came through, blank book, on the train, new catastrophe
My god, there's a body on the train right in front of me
Don't look, she's a demon, strolls the sewers, no apologies
I need a dirty girl to help me brush up my biology
This way to a place, she's right in front of me
I can pray, and she got it 'cuz she got it where she wants to be
Run through, spread down like a naked buffet
We gonna (mangerie[?]) and then play for days
So first we spark and blaze and then we go away
And then we go away and then we go three way
(And then we shift our fate and then my baby say)
So first we spark and blaze and then we blow away
(So first we spark and blaze and then we play for days)
And then we play for days and then we go away
(And then we spark and blaze and then we go three way)
And then we spark and blaze and then we play for days

And then we go three way and the my baby say

Roll out from the bedside and cut from the past
Roll home, kicking lovely and lonely at last
Cigarette all ablaze as I tread the rat's maze

Better fall into my chamber 'fore I fall into the trap
A skin addiction, a benediction for all my pistons

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there

You remember it all

You remember it all

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well

Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life

I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own

And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody

[Verse 2]
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding

Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

For a moment, I knew cosmic love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""

Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us

When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

[Verse 2]
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
And then she wrotе headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'

Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

[Bridge]
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you

[Verse 3]
And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singin'
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
And our town, it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, ""Thank you, Aimee"" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
So I pushed each boulder up that hill

I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses

Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice

[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over
[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""

I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason

And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls

Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Verse 2]
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?

Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously

And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off

The who's who of ""Who's that?"" is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about ""sad""

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
You should be

[Verse 2]
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me you feel bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke
Then we could all just laugh until I cry

[Chorus]
So I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?

But what if it is?
Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singin' along

So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream

Adorned with smoke on my clothes

Love thorns all over this rose

And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny

All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
And in my mind, they sink into the swamp

But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom

Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so

We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor

I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow

We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

Summer went away, still, the yearning stays

I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

You're on your own, kid
You always have been

I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid

Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner

Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents

When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven

Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool, baby, with me

When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?"" you say
""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""
I see you every day now

[Chorus]
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

[Verse 2]
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us

Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Fresh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 1]
Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 2]
Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again

For just one glimpse of his smile
All those nights, he kept me goin'
Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'

[Bridge]
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings

And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

But maybe this thing was a masterpiece

So casually cruel in the name of being honest

'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea

Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that
[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]

I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down

But I'm here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad

I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist

A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked

But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances

Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?

How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground

On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time

[Pre-Chorus]
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dеsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind

[Verse 2]
You see, all the wisеst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game

The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
Like a freight train through a small town
The jokes that he told across the bar
Were revolting and far too loud

The dopamine races through his brain
On a six-lane Texas highway
His hand so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face
And I could see it from a mile away
A perfect case for my certain skill set
He had a halo of the highest gradе

One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true

Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world

It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, love my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

You know it used to be mad love

If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering

[Verse 2]
If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us

Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catchin' my breath
Starin' out an open window, catchin' my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey, December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)
(If you think of all the cost)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there

And I was catchin' my breath
Floors of a cabin creakin' under my step

Quick, quick, tell me something awful
Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize
You see, I was a debutante in another life, but
Now I seem to be scared to go outside
If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck
Now that I know what's what

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

[Verse 2]
My friends used to play a game where
We would pick a decade
We wished we could live in instead of this
I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists
And getting married off for the highest bid
Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now
Seems like it was never even fun back then
Nostalgia is a mind's trick
If I'd been there, I'd hate it
It was freezing in the palace

I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

[Bridge]
I'm lonely, but I'm good
I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine
I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose
This place made me feel worthless
Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me
And in my fantasies, I rise above it
And way up there, I actually love it

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to, the only one is mine

You forgot to turn it off
And it hits me

At you for makin' me feel this way
But what can I say? You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)

But if you're single, that's honestly worse

Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain

With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door

Now and then, she rereads the manuscript
Of the entire torrid affair
They compared their licenses
He said, ""I'm not a donor but
I'd give you my heart if you needed it""
She rolled her eyes and said
""You're a professional""
He said, ""No, just a good samaritan""
He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
Soon, they'd be pushin' strollers
But, soon, it was over

[Verse 2]
In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press
Afterwards, she only atе kids' cereal
And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
Then she dated boys who were her own age
With dart boards on the backs of their doors
She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
Everything had been above board
She wasn't sure

[Bridge]
And the years passed like scenes of a show
The professor said to write what you know
Lookin' backwards might be the only way to move forward
Then the actors were hitting their marks
And the slow dance was alight with the sparks
And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
And at last, she knew what the agony had been for

Taylor Swift,Daylight,"141 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeУкраїнськаSvenskaDeutschРусскийEspañolHrvatskiPortuguêsPolskiItalianoFrançaisDaylight Lyrics[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)

I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look, oh, so easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothin'
I don't regret it one bit 'cause he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did somethin' bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did somethin' bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

And you saw my bones out with somebody new
Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school

If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered

You turned me into an idea of sorts
You needed me, but you needed drugs more

Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
All to outrun my desertion of you

Too impaired by my youth to know what to do

And you have some kids with an internet starlet
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon

Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be

We hereby conduct this post-mortem
He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
Our maladies were such we could not cure them
And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign

[Chorus]
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
We must know
How did it end?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learned thе right steps to different dancеs
And fell victim to interlopers' glances
Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins

Pad around when I get home

And I sound like an infant
Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen

But I howl like a wolf at the moon
And I look unstable
Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table
A greater woman has faith
But even statues crumble if they're made to wait
I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
No sign of soulmates
I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige
Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard

I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Verse 2]
What should be over, burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Bridge]
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

I-I-I-I

[Verse 1]
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I’ve been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?

[Chorus]
’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I-I

[Verse 2]
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

Forgive me, Peter
My lost fearless leader
In closets like cedar
Preserved from when we were just kids
Is it somethin' I did?
The goddess of timing
Once found us beguiling
She said she was trying
Peter, was she lying?
My ribs get the feeling she did

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna come down
I thought it was just goodbye for now

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Thеn you were gonna come find mе
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep
But never to keep
Oh, never to keep

Are you still a mind reader?
A natural scene-stealer?
I've heard great things, Peter
But life was always easier on you
Than it was on me
And sometimes it gets me
When crossing your jet stream
We both did the best we could do
Underneath the same moon
In different galaxies

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna hang around
We said it was just goodbye for now

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep
But never to keep
Never to keep
[Bridge]
And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return
With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned
'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
Lost to the ""Lost Boys"" chapter of your life
Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
To hold on (Hold on) to the days (To the days)
When you were mine
But the woman who sits by the window
Has turned out the light

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up

If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 2]
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say

This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew

Taylor Swift,London Boy,"118 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeDeutschРусскийEspañolHrvatskiPortuguêsPolskiFrançaisItalianoLondon Boy Lyrics[Intro: Idris Elba & James Corden]
We can go drivin' in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London (Oh, I'd—)

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But somethin' happened, I heard him laughin'
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent

[Pre-Chorus]
They say, ""Home is where the heart is""
But that's not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin' Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni' and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watchin' rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time

Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia?
Did some force take you bеcause I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

Been here all along, so why can't you see?

I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that

You had people who called you on unmarked numbers

I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
And when it came to you

We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

[Verse 2]
I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion
Walkin' in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
With the pages ripped out
I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium
And I can still see you now

Patching up the crack along the wall

'Cause that's where I was when I got the call

When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
In the streets, there's a raging riot
When it's ""Burn the bitch,"" they're shrieking
When the truth comes out, it's quiet

So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

Twisting all my smiles into snarls
They say, ""What doesn't kill you makes you aware""
What happens if it becomes who you are?

And tried to tell the town
So they set my life in flames, I regret to say

I said, ""Remember this moment""

The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same

On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders

Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering, where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me?
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

I think that I forgot to say your name

My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

[Chorus]
All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the lеtter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If wе survived the Great War

[Verse 2]
You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back

Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning

Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun

Taylor Swift,The Bolter,"92 ContributorsTranslationsالعربيةFrançaisفارسیСрпскиItalianoEspañolPortuguêsDeutschNorsk (bokmål / riksmål)TürkçePolskiThe Bolter Lyrics[Verse 1]
By all accounts, she almost drowned
When she was six in frigid water
And I can confirm she made
A curious child, ever reviled
By everyone except her own father
With a quite bewitching face
Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
Then she runs like it's a race
Behind her back, her best mates laughed
And they nicknamed her ""The Bolter""

[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing

[Post-Chorus]
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive

He was a cad, wanted her bad
Just like any good trophy hunter
And she liked the way it tastes
Taming a bear, making him care
Watching him jump then pulling him under
And at first blush, this is fate
When it's all roses, portrait poses
Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats
What a charming Saturday
That's when she sees the littlest leaks
Down in the floorboards
And she just knows she must bolt

[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding

Men of many faces
First, they're off to the races
And she's laughing, drawin' aces
But none of it is changin'

Hearts are hers for the breakin'
There's escape in escaping

Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god

Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimmin' in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feelin' so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darlin'
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shakin' my hand
And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, I'm right where you left me

Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight,"" I
I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared right where

[Chorus]
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

And you're sitting in front of me

Looking at it now

We were lying on your couch

You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too

Back against the wall

But when you get me alone, it's so simple

So it goes

You know I'm not a bad girl, but I do bad things with you
So it goes

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist

Wear you like a necklace

They tell you while you're young
""Girls, go out and have your fun""
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, ""She looks like she's been through it""

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?
[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]
How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?

When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

[Verse 2]
When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met

[Chorus]
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless

I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face

[Chorus]
In the 1500s, off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
[Bridge]
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, ""Hello""

[Chorus]
In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""

[Post-Chorus]
We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been

Taylor Swift,Dear John,"95 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisAfrikaansEspañolPortuguêsDear John Lyrics[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

Never impressed by me acing your tests

My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head

You will never learn your lesson""

I know how to act like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation
But I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinkin' you'll come around
And maybe, someday, when we're older
This is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news

Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift]
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept

We are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing

We team up, then switch sides like a record changer

Taylor Swift,Why She Disappeared [Poem],"34 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoРусскийSvenskaPortuguêsFrançaisWhy She Disappeared [Poem] LyricsWhen she fell, she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends

When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
""Whatever you say, it is not right.""
""Whatever you do, it is not enough.""
""Your kindness is fake.""
""Your pain is manipulative.""

When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.

When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes

When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.

""May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice""

By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance

Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

[Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Taylor Swift,Holy Ground,"56 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsFrançaisTürkçeHoly Ground Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

One look, dark room, meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Verse 2]
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks, you fight and you talk
One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love

But you got here early and you stand and wave

You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me

And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me

And I realize the blame is on me

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2]
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never (Never)

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now, all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah

When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

Taylor Swift,You All Over Me (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault],"99 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolСрпскиPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisMagyarPolskiItalianoYou All Over Me (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault] Lyrics[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
You can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

Taylor Swift,Ours,"42 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisAfrikaansOurs Lyrics[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say

[Chorus]
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

Taylor Swift,Better Than Revenge,"85 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschFrançaisAfrikaansPortuguêsEspañolBetter Than Revenge Lyrics[Intro]
Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)
Haha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

He's up, 3AM, pacin'
He says, ""It's not just a phase I'm in""
My voice comes out beggin'

All this time, I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

[Verse 2]
He seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead

See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out

They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say, ""It's in the past,"" you drive straight ahead
You're thinkin' that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good

And remember what we were fighting for and I
Wish you knew that

Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses

And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

You bite your nails,
And laugh when you're nervous.
You promise people the world,
because that's what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
But darling, you need to stop,

If you're anything like me,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
If life gets too good now,
Darling, it scares you.
If you're anything like me,
You never wanted to lock your door,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
But Darling, now you have to.

If you're anything like me,
There's a justice system in your head
For names you'll never speak again,
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you,
In your own little golden prison cell...
But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $72If you're anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
But Darling, you keep trying.

If you're anything like me,
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
Darling, later on you will thank your stars
for that frightful day.

If you're anything like me,
I'm sorry.

But Darling, it's going to be okay.24Embed",you bite your nails and laugh when youre nervous. you promise people the world because thats what they want from you. you like giving them what they want but darling you need to stop  if youre anything like me you knock on wood every time you make plans. you cross your fingers hold your breath wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck. rest in peace to your naive bravado if life gets too good now darling it scares you. if youre anything like me you never wanted to lock your door your secret garden gate or your diary drawer didnt want to face the you you dont know anymore for fear she was much better before but darling now you have to. if youre anything like me theres a justice system in your head for names youll never speak again and you make your ruthless rulings. each new enemy turns to steel they become the bars that confine you in your own little golden prison cell but darling there is where you meet yourself. see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as $72if youre anything like me youve grown to hate your pride to love your thighs and no amount of friends at 25 will fill the empty seats at the lunch tables of your past the teams that picked you last but darling you keep trying. if youre anything like me you couldnt recognize the face of your love until they stripped you of your shiny paint threw your victory flag away and you saw the ones who wanted you anyway darling later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day. if youre anything like me im sorry. but darling its going to be okay.

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back

Taylor Swift,Reputation [Prologue],"30 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolРусскийPortuguêsFrançaisReputation [Prologue] LyricsHere's something I've learned about people.

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.

This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.

The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.
When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?

Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...
We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day

Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be

And soon enough, you're best friends

We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car

But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead

It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they’re right
You were outnumbered this time

[Chorus]
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run

So run, and run, and run

[Verse 2]
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget

[Pre-Chorus]
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

Like diamonds in the sky

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)
Haha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealin' from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
That no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

Taylor Swift,Never Grow Up,"56 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisEspañolPortuguêsAfrikaansNever Grow Up Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight

[Pre-Chorus]
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

[Post-Chorus]
Never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone

So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up

And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out

Taylor Swift,Come Back... Be Here,"47 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisEspañolPortuguêsCome Back... Be Here Lyrics[Verse 1]
You said it in a simple way
4 a.m. the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Chorus]
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Verse 2]
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When the porch lights were shinin' bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy
I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

On the boats in the water

Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now, you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did

I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried

Oh, my, my, my, my

I wasn't that little girl you used to see

Taylor Swift,Ronan,"41 ContributorsRonan Lyrics[Verse 1]
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm

Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness

You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no

Taylor Swift,Beautiful Ghosts,"30 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisTürkçeEspañolСрпскиPolskiBeautiful Ghosts Lyrics[Verse 1]
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Verse 2]
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts12Embed",follow me home if you dare to i wouldnt know where to lead you should i take chances when no one took chances on me so i watch from the dark wait for my life to start with no beauty in my memory  all that i wanted was to be wanted too young to wander london streets alone and haunted born into nothing at least you have something something to cling to visions of dazzling rooms ill never get let into and the memories were lost long ago but at least you have beautiful ghosts  perilous night their voices calling a flicker of light before the dawning out here the wild ones are taming the fear within me scared to call them my friends and be broken again is this hope just a mystical dream all that i wanted was to be wanted too young to wander london streets alone and haunted born into nothing at least you have something something to cling to visions of dazzling rooms ill never get let into and the memories were lost long ago but at least you have beautiful ghosts  and so maybe my home isnt what i had known what i thought it would be but i feel so alive with these phantoms of night and i know that this life isnt safe but its wild and its free  all that i wanted was to be wanted ill never wander london streets alone and haunted born into nothing with them i have something something to cling to i never knew id love this world theyve let me into and the memories were lost long ago so ill dance with these beautiful ghosts and the memories were lost long ago so ill dance with these beautiful ghosts

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fеarless

[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road

It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again,
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought,
How can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.

Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha)

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear
And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better

[Pre-Chorus]
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

Taylor Swift,Red (Original Demo Recording),"24 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisRed (Original Demo Recording) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all
[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
[Verse 2]
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride

But you're coming undone, oh

Passing by unbeknownst to me

And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

Down the stairs, I was there

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

Saying, ""Does he know?""
Will you ever know?

I hope your life leads you back to my door

So I can save 'em for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand...

Taylor Swift,Superman,"37 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisAfrikaansSuperman Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, ""How are you?”
I say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

While havin' coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feelin' on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darlin', it was good
Never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

I never dreamed of this

This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)

Flickered in my mind for only you

And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do

[Verse 2]
I walked in, expectin' you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave, I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wеdnesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Verse 3]
You said you nеver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy, but I do

But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

Taylor Swift,​cardigan (voice memo),"14 ContributorsTranslationsFrançais​cardigan (voice memo) LyricsSo first of all, I'm obsessed with, like, pretty much all of these tracks, and it was really hard to figure out like what I wanted to write first because I had thoughts for all of them, so, unbelievable archives, I can't believe you have this just, like, laying around, that's ... ridiculous, these are unbelievable. But anyway, the first one that I... I was working something up for is the ""Maple"" one? And I came up with this thing, and it's probably gonna obviously like be sequencing differences like, you know, different lengths and different verses and whatever, but this is just like a rough, uh, thing. 

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Living in a gold age
Sneaking to my bird cage, I
I knew you
Laughing like a damn fool
Breaking every damn rule, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Instrumental Break]
And then, I have like this-- there's like a break, because I don't really know what's gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think it's here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing. 

[Bridge]
And to kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
Now I'm bleedin'
I'm bleedin'

[Instrumental Break]
We'll work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, there's all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait 'til then, and then, I start singing again. I don't think it's right now, but... there it is. The ending. 
[Chorus]
I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter leaving Wendy, I
I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
That when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
I knew I'd wish you would've changed your mind
I knew you'd miss me once the moment died
I knew to love would be to lose my mind

And then, I don't know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, that's just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it. 2Embed",vintage tee brand new phone high heels on cobblestones when you are young they assume you know nothing sequin smile black lipstick sensual politics when you are young they assume you know nothing  but i knew you dancin in your levis drunk under a streetlight i i knew you hand under my sweatshirt baby kiss it better i  and when i felt like i was an old cardigan under someones bed you put me on and said i was your favorite  a friend to all is a friend to none chase two girls lose the one when you are young they assume you know nothing  but i knew you living in a gold age sneaking to my bird cage i i knew you laughing like a damn fool breaking every damn rule i  and when i felt like i was an old cardigan under someones bed you put me on and said i was your favorite  and then i have like this theres like a break because i dont really know whats gonna happen here but i do have like a i think its here was where i was putting a a bridge thing.   and to kiss in cars and downtown bars was all we needed you drew stars around my scars now im bleedin im bleedin  well work on that and not make it bad. and then um theres all this time but when the like kind of major chorus comes back in i wait til then and then i start singing again. i dont think its right now but there it is. the ending.   i knew you steppin on the last train marked me like a bloodstain i i knew you tried to change the ending peter leaving wendy i i knew you dancing in your levis drunk under a streetlight i i knew you that when you are young they assume you know nothing  but i knew youd linger like a stolen kiss i knew youd haunt all of my what ifs the smell of smoke would hang around this long cause i knew everything when i was young i knew id curse you for the longest time i knew id wish you wouldve changed your mind i knew youd miss me once the moment died i knew to love would be to lose my mind and then i dont know. you let me know what you think. and uh thats just kind of like a rough idea of something. let me know if you like it.

In the heat of the fight, I walked away

I said, ""This time I've had enough""
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not pickin' up

'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwin' pebbles
Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Well, me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
But I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be

When you said you needed space, what?

Taylor Swift,Jump Then Fall,"44 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisJump Then Fall Lyrics[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
""We should be together""

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall

[Verse 2]
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is, ""Come closer""
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me

Taylor Swift,Speak Now (Taylor’s Version),"22 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolFrançaisPortuguêsMagyarСрпскиTürkçeItalianoAfrikaansDeutschRomânăPolskiSpeak Now (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Spеak now""

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are еxchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""

And I said, ""Stay, stay, stay""
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me

It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

Here's to silence that cuts me to the core

And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spеnd forever wonderin' if you knеw
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

You good to go?

Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind makin' me feel like

Hey, hey, T-Swizzle (T-Swizzle)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift & T-Pain]
I'm like eight foot fo', blonde hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No, I ain't got a gun, no, I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents, but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster, you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing, but I just made caramel delights (Mmm, mmm, good)
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me, can you handle that?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & T-Pain & Both]
I had a dream last night
I had high top Nikes
I had diamonds in my mouth
And diamonds on my mic
By the time I woke, I was singing
""I'm on a boat"", woah, oh-oh
'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper
Shorty, I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo
Shorty, I'm a take ya
You can call me T-Sweezy
Now I'm a rap star
Hey, It's a thug story

Singer turned gangster
You don't want to fight me
Straight to the top
In my extra small white tee

I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night, out the window
We were seventeen and crazy, runnin' wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playin' whеn we walked in
The night wе snuck into a yacht club party
Pretendin' to be a duchess and a prince

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Verse 2]
He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change""
""You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinkin' that way""
He was tryin' to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?""
""Don't you dream impossible things?""

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""I can't take my eyes off of you""
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Verse 2]
Morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

You're not sorry
No, no, no, no

You're lookin' so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waitin' in the cold
And you've got your sharе of secrets and I'm tired of bein' last to know, oh
And now you're askin' me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
