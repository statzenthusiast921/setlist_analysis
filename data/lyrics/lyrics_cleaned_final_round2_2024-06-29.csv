[Verse 1: Ben Schneider, Ben Schneider & Phoebe Bridgers]
I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

[Chorus: Ben Schneider & Phoebe Bridgers, Ben Schneider]
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]

I'm leavin' this place behind
And I'm headin' down on the road tonight
I'm off for the Hinterlands
Way up north to where the tall trees stand
Before I commence my ride
I'm askin' Lily to be my bride
I know there's another man
But he ain't gonna delay my plans

[Chorus]
I know she gonna be my wife
Gonna fall in love, I'm gonna live my life with her
You know, I bet he's not so tough
Ain't afraid of him 'cause I'm a fool for love

[Verse 2]
I come forward to find Big Jim
Well, here I am and I guess you're him
I see how you got your name
You're tall as hell and broad as a train
You say you're a hard-worn man
Oh, the baddest guy in the whole wide land
Well, I'm not afraid to fight
Let's step outside and I'll show you why

You know, you don't hit half-bad
Oh, but I'm gonna lay you to ground tonight, oh
Just wait until I catch my breath
Gonna send you off to an early death

[Verse 3]
I lie in the drifting snow
Bleeding out as it covers me over
If spring comes before I'm found
Just throw my bones in a hole in the ground
I lost friends along my way
I knew I'd need 'em eventually
No, I'm not afraid to die
Just mad I left Big Jim alive

[Chorus]
I know I should've never looked back
But you ain't gonna win a woman's heart like that, oh
I never should have called his bluff
I was born to lose 'cause I'm a fool for love

And the sorry tale of my life goes by, oh
I drift into the great unknown

Will I find you when the night is over?
Tell me where did you go?
I've been searching high and low
I have only 'til the night is over

Your reflection in the glass
Makes me wonder if my mind is going
Shadows shifting in the rain
Slowly driving me insane
By the stars above, I know we were in love
I have only 'til the night is over

I watch the birds fly by
I see an emerald in the sky

What you're looking for won't be found easily
It grows upon the mountain in a sacred place
Up beyond the clouds, in ancient ground, so they say
And many men have died trekking up that way
[Instrumental]

Once he's gazed upon her, a man is forever changed
The bravest men return with darkened hearts and phantom pain
Ages come and go, but her life goes on the same
She lives to see the sun and feel the wind and drink the rain

[Verse 3]
Her colors change to mark the passing of the days
No earthly sight can match the beauty she displays
And when I die, I want her lying by my side
In my grave, in my grave

[Verse 1]
I had a name, but they took it from me
I was the man that I wanted to be
I had a place where I lay my head, but
They burnt it to the ground, and the sky turned red
I had a life and a place in the world
I had a sweet-talkin' wife and a beautiful girl
I know I'm never gonna see 'em again
Gonna tear the world up until I have my revenge

They took my life
But it isn't the end
They put me in the ground
But I'm back from the dead

Close your eyes now, the light is fading

Lost in time and space
Aimless drifting in a far-off place
Hurtling through the vast unknown
Staring straight into a pure, black void
Drowning in the sea of stars
Lost in a galaxy of cocktail bars
Blinded by the neon lights
I lie awake and say your name into the night

I guess she's gone for good
She don't call me like I thought she would
She went west to chase her dreams
She took my money, but she didn't take me
Why go wander unknown worlds?
Stay right here and let the cosmos twirl
Blind without her source of light
I light a flame and say her name into the night

Lost in time and space
Aimless searching for a long, lost face
Haven't got a thing to lose
If I don't find her, gonna tie that noose

Left in a hurry and I've sure come far
Driving fast with no headlights

Leave me where the light pours down through the trees like rain
Let it wash over me like a flood, let it ease my pain
Let it drown me

[Pre-Chorus]
For a while I was held by the myth of the lost highway
In the spell of the night and the lights of the great white way
I ain't lonely, are you?

[Chorus]
Send me to the mountains
Let me go free forever
I'll be running through the forest
Dancing in the fields like this
Long lost

[Verse 2]
Leave me where the moonbeams carve through the leaves like blades
Lay me in the tall-grown grass in a shallow grave
Let it have me

[Verse 3]
I've got a place in the world and I found out where
Out in the night all alone in the way out there
I ain't lonely
I'm long lost
Say goodbye, long lost
Out of my mind, long lost

You chained my life to an ancient master
Will the curse be reversed if I say it backwards?

Does he make you say his name?
And you can't get it off your tongue

Does it hurt when you lie to me

But the time to forgive is gone

Ain't you worried what I'll do?
And that boy should worry, too
Can you face me for what you've done?
Little girl, you're not so young

Oh, is he ready to die for you, baby?
Naw, but you know I was

Maybe I don't mind
Are you dead or are you alive?""

Long before the sunrise

I will draw her eyes with the pigment of my mind
I will trace her lines
'Cause I have traced them thousands of times

All my nights are empty
I just stare out into space
Searching for her eyes in a never-ending sky
Leave me where I lie

Everyone’s a sinner in the balancer’s eye
I’ve prayed enough, I rolled the dice
Anyone’s luck can turn, I’ve heard
Not soon enough, I gave my word

I was born right into nothing
Under a very bad sign
Can I cross beyond that line?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?

Nothing’s waiting for us in the great sky
Life is equal to dust in the balancer’s eye
Now I know that I can’t lift an old curse
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Will I ever be forgiven for the crime of my life?
Will it haunt me ’til I die?

'Cause you hold your life when you hold that flame
I get a kick outta thunder and lightnin'
And tearing through the night hollerin' your name

[Verse 2]
I get a laugh outta starin' at darkness
And wondering why people live in the light
I drive fast, and I rumble the hardest
I don't feel alive if I ain't in the fight

[Verse 3]
I can't sleep when there's something to do
You spend your whole life dreamin', and you wake up dead
It's a long night, can I spend it with you?
'Cause you're oh-so pretty when you stand on the edge

[Chorus 1]
Oh, little darlin', don't you look charmin'
Here in the eye of a hurricane
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Oh, come inside; can I get you to stay?

[Chorus 2]
Oh, little darlin', don't you like fallin' down
Through the sky like a divin' plane?
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Now, come inside; can I get you to stay?

Lord Huron,Dead Man’s Hand,"20 ContributorsDead Man’s Hand Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yellow lines in the dead of the night
Oh, I was heading back out west
Trying to keep my eyes open wide
I'd gone days without any rest
Saw him lying in the road looking bad
About 20 yards ahead
You come back from a trip to the East
But you don't come back from the dead

[Verse 2]
Sure as hell, he was dead as they come
And he was already starting to smell
Just a kid with his hair slicked back
And a knife tucked into his belt
Was he unforgiven or just tired of living a life
That never felt like his?
Though I was worn and weary, I thought I'd bury him
And lay his soul to rest out in the desert night

[Verse 3]
I laid him down in a grave in the sand
And he grabbed my arm with his dead man's hand
He said, ""I know I'm dead, but I don't wanna lie
In a grave out here where the coyotes cry
I stared right into the endless void
And I ain't going back if I got any choice
I know how to live, I don't know how to die
And there ain't no thrills in the afterlife

And I'll wander the night till the ages end""

And he waved goodbye with his dead man's hand

I've been running through life and cruising toward death
If you think that I'm scared, you've got me wrong
If you don't know my name, you'll know it now
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those that came first
There are many more flames when mine is gone
They will build me no shrines and sing me no songs

I'm a long way from the one that I loved
I've been tending old flames, lamenting what was
Drifting in a land that time forgot
If you think that I've changed, you know me not

Gonna wander out there and see what I'm worth

I wanna live in a land of lakes
Where the great waves break
And the night runs right into the day
Wanna be with ones I left
But I’m way out west
And the years keep on slipping away

Wanna run on the sacred dunes
Through the ancient ruins
Where the fires of my ancestors burned
I remember that fateful day
When I ran away
And you told me I couldn’t return

[Chorus]
You made me swear I’d never forget
I made a vow I’d see you again
I will be back one day
And I’ll find you there by the great big lake

If you are who you say you are, then show your face

What I remember the most
Is hollering her name
And the sirens wail as we ran like hell
Down a strange trail
Oh, I wanna know what I did
I wanna know her game
I wanna learn her wits
And how she plays her tricks
Oh, I gotta know

[Verse 2]
Lots of booze and her kiss
These are drugs that do not mix
I was under her spell
And today, I feel like hell
She got me going, I guess
But who knew love would be like this?
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I guess I gotta see it through

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how to walk out of this deal
The spell she cast on me is real
Don't know how to right the wrongs I've done

And look into those eyes
And see the endless night
Staring back

[Verse 3]
What kind of magic is this?
I was doomed by our first kiss
Just a pawn in her game
I've done things that have no name
And she'll make me do worse
If the law doesn't get me first

And I know I can't turn back

There are runes on my skin,
They appear when she walks in

Where have you been, darlin'? What have you done?

There's a fire in your eyes and there's blood on your hands

Rest awhile, they're coming for you
There's a price to be paid for the things that we do

Fall asleep and forget all your troubles
Dream of laughter and old friends and lovers
Dream of when you were innocent
Dream forever

She was wise beyond all others
On the island, she was my lover
We went wild and it almost killed me, I was blind
But for thirteen days of sun and her, I thought I'd never die

I couldn't get tired, though I should have been sleeping
For the first time, I wasn't hard of feeling
And at night, while the others were dreaming, we went wild
We'd go running through the temples and the forests of the isle
For thirteen of those sleepless nights I thought I'd never die

[Verse 2]
I don't know what the hell it was that gave me so much life
On the island, we went wild; we never closed our eyes
Don't know where she's gone or what she's done to who since then
She loved me right into the ground; I won't go wild again

I thought good times could last forever
Long nights and perfect weather
I tried to never say never, but I was wrong
The wildness of those days, well, they couldn't last for long
I woke up on the beach one day and found that she had gone
The rains had come, there was no sun, I felt so deadly tired
After thirteen days of loving her, I felt like I could die

A long lost soul in the wilderness alone

I'm leavin' this place behind
And I'm headin' down on the road tonight
I'm off for the Hinterlands
Way up north to where the tall trees stand
Before I commence my ride
I'm askin' Lily to be my bride
I know there's another man
But he ain't gonna delay my plans

[Chorus]
I know she gonna be my wife
Gonna fall in love, I'm gonna live my life with her
You know, I bet he's not so tough
Ain't afraid of him 'cause I'm a fool for love

[Verse 2]
I come forward to find Big Jim
Well, here I am and I guess you're him
I see how you got your name
You're tall as hell and broad as a train
You say you're a hard-worn man
Oh, the baddest guy in the whole wide land
Well, I'm not afraid to fight
Let's step outside and I'll show you why

You know, you don't hit half-bad
Oh, but I'm gonna lay you to ground tonight, oh
Just wait until I catch my breath
Gonna send you off to an early death

I lie in the drifting snow
Bleeding out as it covers me over
If spring comes before I'm found
Just throw my bones in a hole in the ground
I lost friends along my way
I knew I'd need 'em eventually
No, I'm not afraid to die
Just mad I left Big Jim alive

I know I should've never looked back
But you ain't gonna win a woman's heart like that, oh
I never should have called his bluff
I was born to lose 'cause I'm a fool for love

Will I find you when the night is over?
Tell me where did you go?

I have only 'til the night is over

Your reflection in the glass
Makes me wonder if my mind is going
Shadows shifting in the rain
Slowly driving me insane
By the stars above, I know we were in love
I have only 'til the night is over

I watch the birds fly by
I see an emerald in the sky

Lord Huron,The World Ender,"25 ContributorsThe World Ender Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I had a name, but they took it from me
I was the man that I wanted to be
I had a place where I lay my head, but
They burnt it to the ground, and the sky turned red
I had a life and a place in the world
I had a sweet-talkin' wife and a beautiful girl
I know I'm never gonna see 'em again
Gonna tear the world up until I have my revenge

[Pre-Chorus]
They took my life
But it isn't the end
They put me in the ground
But I'm back from the dead

Baby

[Chorus]
I'm the World Ender, baby, and I'm coming for them
They put me in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
I'm the World Ender, baby, and I'm coming for them
They put me in the ground, but I'm back from the dead

That's how you'll know that I'm coming for you
Gonna find you alone in the dark of night
When the World Ender comes, baby, run for your life
I'll never bleed, and I won't ever age
I'll never feel the embrace of the grave
The fair and the brave and the good must die
I seen the other side of living; I know heaven's a lie

I'll tear through the night
And I'll raise some hell
Cause I'm the World Ender, baby
And I'm back from the dead

Lord knows I should be pushing up daisies
I was six feet down, but something raised me up
Sent back for to lift my curse
I'm gonna get me a taste of some chaos first
Untied, gonna get little wild
Go screaming through the dark like a demon child
Close your eyes now, the light is fading
And the noise in the night is gonna get a little louder, baby
Baby

Lost in time and space
Aimless drifting in a far-off place
Hurtling through the vast unknown
Staring straight into a pure, black void
Drowning in the sea of stars
Lost in a galaxy of cocktail bars
Blinded by the neon lights
I lie awake and say your name into the night

[Verse 1]
I guess she's gone for good
She don't call me like I thought she would
She went west to chase her dreams
She took my money, but she didn't take me
Why go wander unknown worlds?
Stay right here and let the cosmos twirl
Blind without her source of light
I light a flame and say her name into the night

[Refrain]
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am

[Chorus]
Lost in time and space
Aimless searching for a long, lost face
Haven't got a thing to lose
If I don't find her, gonna tie that noose
I quit my job and packed my car
Left in a hurry and I've sure come far
Driving fast with no headlights
I'm wide awake, I say her name into the night

Where the only souls I see are ghosts

And I chase the sunlight mile after mile

And I feel like I know this place
As the tree line breaks into wide-open space
I stare at a bright red sun
Though I search all day, I never find anyone

In the deep of the night near the edge of the known
I pass by a moonlit lake
And a cold wind blows and my bones start to shake

And I feel I should know this place
As the road winds on into wide-open space
The wind plays a haunting tone
As I make my way through the night all alone

I know the rain like the clouds know the sky
I speak to birds and tell them where to fly
I sing the songs that you hear on the breeze
I write the names of the rocks and the trees

Oh, you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins

[Verse 2]
I tried to warn you when you were a child
I told you not to get lost in the wild
I sent you omens and all kinds of signs
I taught you melodies, poems, and rhymes

I sit alone in the dark, and I try to remember
The words you spoke when you summoned the Ender
You chained my life to an ancient master
Will the curse be reversed if I say it backwards?

[Verse 2]
What you crossed was a line at the edge of the void
And you can’t crawl back without making a choice
But then something escaped when you opened the gate
You cheated death and sealed your fate

Put on your new dress tonight
Have a look to the west, the moon’s in the sky

Wanna leave the Earth and my things behind

Deep into the night

And I look up to the sky
And I know you're still alive
But I wonder where you are
I call your name into the dark

And I don't know where I've been
All alone on a mountainside
And huddled in the wind

And it feels like I've been away for an era
But nothing has changed at all
And it feels like I've been with you
But, oh, what did you do and where have you gone?

On the night you disappeared
Oh, if I had seen you clear

Was shining right into my eyes

Staring out at the setting sun

With that boy you call your friend

And it's driving me insane
Does he make you say his name?
And you can't get it off your tongue
Little girl, you are not so young
Does it hurt when you lie to me
If you'd asked, I would set you free
But the time to forgive is gone
The day has passed, the night has come

Ain't you worried what I'll do?
And that boy should worry, too
Can you face me for what you've done?
Little girl, you're not so young

Oh, is he ready to die for you, baby?
Naw, but you know I was
I'm fond of living
But I would have given it all for the girl I love
Oh, is he ready to die for you, baby?

I will wake her in the morning
Once the dew has dried
I will say it to her face
""You're a conjured lie, you're a figment of my mind
Maybe I don't mind
Are you dead or are you alive?""

[Verse 2]
She was gone without a warning
Long before the sunrise
I will paint her perfect face
I will draw her eyes with the pigment of my mind
I will trace her lines
'Cause I have traced them thousands of times

[Verse 3]
All my days are filled with mourning
All my nights are empty
I just stare out into space
Searching for her eyes in a never-ending sky
Leave me where I lie
I don't care if I live or die

I will never ever love another one the way I loved her
If I ever learn to love again
I will wait until the end

Here tomorrow, gone today
Heaven won’t let me in, I don’t know why
No one ever loved half as much as I
Everyone’s a sinner in the balancer’s eye
I’ve prayed enough, I rolled the dice
Anyone’s luck can turn, I’ve heard
Not soon enough, I gave my word

I was born right into nothing
Under a very bad sign
Can I cross beyond that line?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?

Nothing’s waiting for us in the great sky
Life is equal to dust in the balancer’s eye
Now I know that I can’t lift an old curse
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Will I ever be forgiven for the crime of my life?
Will it haunt me ’til I die?

Lord Huron,Dead Man’s Hand,"20 ContributorsDead Man’s Hand Lyrics[Verse 1]
Yellow lines in the dead of the night
Oh, I was heading back out west
Trying to keep my eyes open wide
I'd gone days without any rest
Saw him lying in the road looking bad
About 20 yards ahead
You come back from a trip to the East
But you don't come back from the dead

[Verse 2]
Sure as hell, he was dead as they come
And he was already starting to smell
Just a kid with his hair slicked back
And a knife tucked into his belt
Was he unforgiven or just tired of living a life
That never felt like his?
Though I was worn and weary, I thought I'd bury him
And lay his soul to rest out in the desert night

[Verse 3]
I laid him down in a grave in the sand
And he grabbed my arm with his dead man's hand
He said, ""I know I'm dead, but I don't wanna lie
In a grave out here where the coyotes cry
I stared right into the endless void
And I ain't going back if I got any choice
I know how to live, I don't know how to die
And there ain't no thrills in the afterlife

So lift me up out of here, my friend
And I'll wander the night till the ages end""
Lit by the moon, he walked through the sand
And he waved goodbye with his dead man's hand

There are many more flames when mine is gone
They will build me no shrines and sing me no songs

Drifting in a land that time forgot

And the night runs right into the day

And the years keep on slipping away

Wanna run on the sacred dunes

Where the fires of my ancestors burned
I remember that fateful day
When I ran away
And you told me I couldn’t return

I made a vow I’d see you again
I will be back one day

What I remember the most
Is hollering her name
And the sirens wail as we ran like hell
Down a strange trail
Oh, I wanna know what I did
I wanna know her game
I wanna learn her wits
And how she plays her tricks
Oh, I gotta know

[Verse 2]
Lots of booze and her kiss
These are drugs that do not mix
I was under her spell
And today, I feel like hell
She got me going, I guess
But who knew love would be like this?
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I guess I gotta see it through

'Cause I don't know how to walk out of this deal

And look into those eyes
And see the endless night
Staring back

What kind of magic is this?
I was doomed by our first kiss
Just a pawn in her game
I've done things that have no name
And she'll make me do worse
If the law doesn't get me first

And I know I can't turn back

You arise along with the sun
Where have you been, darlin'? What have you done?
You were out finding trouble again
There's a fire in your eyes and there's blood on your hands

Come inside and lie down to sleep
You ain't gonna run and you know that you're beat
Rest awhile, they're coming for you
There's a price to be paid for the things that we do

[Bridge]
Fall asleep and forget all your troubles
Dream of laughter and old friends and lovers
Dream of when you were innocent
Dream forever

[Verse 2]
Lord knows you've been 'round in your day
But this kind of trouble, won't just go away
Darlin', now you're adrift in the deep
So just lay down your head and I'll sing you to sleep

Will you fight with me, brother?

She was wise beyond all others
On the island, she was my lover
We went wild and it almost killed me, I was blind
But for thirteen days of sun and her, I thought I'd never die

I couldn't get tired, though I should have been sleeping
For the first time, I wasn't hard of feeling
And at night, while the others were dreaming, we went wild
We'd go running through the temples and the forests of the isle
For thirteen of those sleepless nights I thought I'd never die

[Verse 2]
I don't know what the hell it was that gave me so much life
On the island, we went wild; we never closed our eyes
Don't know where she's gone or what she's done to who since then
She loved me right into the ground; I won't go wild again

I thought good times could last forever
Long nights and perfect weather
I tried to never say never, but I was wrong
The wildness of those days, well, they couldn't last for long
I woke up on the beach one day and found that she had gone
The rains had come, there was no sun, I felt so deadly tired
After thirteen days of loving her, I felt like I could die

Looking for Heaven, found the devil in me (Oh-woah)

[Verse 2]
I thought that love was in the drugs
But the more I took, the more it took away

You don't have to be afraid
Then it tries to find a home
With people or when I'm alone
Picking it apart
And staring at your phone

We argue in the kitchen about whether to have children
About the world ending and the scale of my ambition
And how much is art really worth?
The very thing you're best at is the thing that hurts the most
But you need your rotten heart, your dazzling pain like diamond rings
You need to go to war to find material to sing
I am no mother, I am no bride, I am king

My empty halls to echo with grand self-mythology
I am no mother, I am no bride, I am king
I am no mother, I am no bride, I am king

But a woman is a changeling, always shifting shape
Just when you think you have it figured out
Something new begins to take
What strangе claws are these scratching at my skin
I nеver knew my killer would be coming from within
I am no mother, I am no bride, I am king
I am no mother, I am no bride, I am king

A good friend told me you've been staying out so late
Be careful, oh, my darling, oh, be careful what it takes
From what I've seen so far, the good ones always seem to break
And I was screaming at my father and you were screaming at me
And I can feel your anger from way across the sea
And I was kissing strangers, I was causing such a scene
Oh, the heart it hides such unimaginable things

Grab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long
I couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
And I want you so badly, but you could be anyone

Aim your arrow at the sky

And all this devotion was rushing out of me

Sometimes, I wonder if I should be medicated
If I would feel better just lightly sedated
The feeling comes so fast and I cannot control it
I'm on fire, but I'm trying not to show it

Chews me up, spits me out
Picks me up, it puts me down

I'm always running from something
I push it back, but it keeps on coming
And being clever never got me very far
Because it's all in my head
""You're too sensitive,"" they said
I said, ""Okay, but let's discuss this at the hospital""

I dreamt last night of a sign that read ""The end of love""
And I remember thinking
Even in my dreaming
It was a good line for a song

We were a family pulled from the flood
You tore the floorboards up
And let the river rush in
Not wash away, wash away

We were reaching in the dark
That summer in New York
And it was so far to fall
But it didn't hurt at all
And let it wash away, wash away

[Verse 2]
In a moment of joy and fury I threw myself
From the balcony like my grandmother so many years before me
I've always been in love with you
Could you tell it from the moment that I met you?

Oh, the king
Gone mad within his suffering
Called out for release
Someone cure him of his grief
His only son
Cut down, but the battle won
Oh, what is it worth
When all that's left is hurt?

Like the stars chase the sun
Over the glowing hill, I will conquer
Blood is running deep
Some things never sleep

Suddenly I'm overcome
Dissolving like the setting sun
Like a boat into oblivion
'Cause you're driving me away
Now you have me on the run
The damage is already done
Come on, is this what you want?

When I go home alone
I drive past the place where I was born
And the places that I used to drink
Young and drunk and stumbling in the street
Outside the Joiners Arms like foals unsteady on their feet
With the art students and the boys in bands
High on E and holding hands with someone that I just met

[Refrain]
I thought, ""It doesn't get better than this
There can be nothing better than this, better than this""

[Verse 2]
And we climbed onto the roof of the museum
And someone made love in the grass
And I forgot my name
And the way back to my mother's house
With your Blackpool eyes and your bitten lips
The world is at your fingertips

[Refrain]
It doesn't get better than this
What else could be better than this?

Of various storms and saints
Parading in the streets
As the banks began to break
And I'm in the throes of it
Somewhere in the belly of the beast

So I gave myself over willingly
You got a hold on me

I am teaching myself how to be free

You tear it down in your head
Don't make the mountain your enemy
Get out, get up there instead
You saw the stars out in front of you
Too tempting not to touch
But even though it shocked you
Something's electric in your blood

That when someone looks at me with real love

Everyone treated us like little pets
Oh, tell me it's not over yet
And in my darkest fantasies
I am the picture of passivity
Waitin' for you side of stage
Suppressing all my private rage
But as my sister said, I'd probably last six days

And there would be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus could come in
About two people sitting doing nothing

[Verse 2]
But I must confess
I did it all for myself
I gathered you here to hide from some vast unnameable fear
But the loneliness never left me
I always took it with me
But I can put it down in the pleasure of your company

[Chorus]
And there will be no grand choirs to sing
No chorus will come in
No ballad will be written
It will be entirely forgotten

And if tomorrow it's all over
At least we had it for a moment
Oh, darling, things seem so unstable

And left me doin' laundry to think on what I'd done
It wasn't me, it was the song

Let it bleed through my fingers, a treasure in my hands
Now I creep out when there's no one about
'Cause they put crosses on the doors to try and keep me out

And I run in the middle of thе road (Ooh)

Florence + the Machine,Bird Song,"33 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiPortuguêsItalianoBird Song Lyrics[Verse]
Well, I didn't tell anyone, but a bird flew by
Saw what I'd done, he set up a nest outside
And he sang about what I'd become
He sang so loud, sang so clear
I was afraid all the neighbours would hear
So I invited him in, just to reason with him
I promised I wouldn't do it again
But he sang louder and louder inside the house
And no I couldn't get him out
So I trapped him under a cardboard box
Stood on it to make him stop
I picked up the bird and above the din I said
""That's the last song you'll ever sing""
Held him down, broke his neck
Taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget
But in my dreams began to creep
That old familiar tweet, tweet, tweet

[Chorus 1]
I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about
But I couldn't scream and I couldn't shout
Couldn't scream and I couldn't shout

[Chorus 2]
I opened my mouth to scream and shout
I waved my arms and flapped about

When they dressed me and they put me on a plane to Memphis, well
I never got to see Elvis
I just sweated it out in a hotel room
But I think the king woulda understood
Why I never made it to Graceland
The bathroom tiles were cool against my hand
I pressed my forehead to the floor and prayed for a trapdoor
I've been here many times before
But I've never made it to Graceland

And if I make it to the mornin'
I shoulda come with a warnin'
And if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be saved

Well, pick me up in New Orleans
Pinned in a bathroom stall
Pick me up above my body
Press my corpse against the wall
I told the band to leave without me
I'll get the next flight
And I'll see you all with Elvis

How did I get here? And how do I get back?
I've been up all night, let's stay awake
Push it further, you know I'll never break
At some point in the party, I thought my heart was failing
You said, ""Hey, you're okay; you seem to be still standing""

I saw the stars and I didn't ask why
Heard the voices and caught my breath
So close and yet so far from death
So close and yet so far from death
So close and yet so far from death

Well, the feeling was always too much for me
It always came too strong
I wanted to get it right so badly that I always got it wrong
So you keep pushing on
You hope it won't be long

And find a way to get along

Somewhere between sorrow and bliss

Oh, grant that I can stay the night
Or one more day inside this life

It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do
To try and keep from calling you
Well, can my dreams keep coming true?
How can they?
'Cause when I sleep, I never dream of you

As if the dream of you, it sleeps too
But it never slips away
It just gains its strength and digs its hooks
To drag me through the day

And I'm caught
I forget all that I've been taught
I can't keep calm, I can't keep still
Pulled apart against my will

You turned to salt as I turned around to look at you

And the heart is hard to translate
It has a language of its own
It talks in tongues and quiet sighs
In prayers and proclamations
In the grand deeds of great men and the smallest of gestures
In short shallow gasps

But with all my education I can't seem to command it
And the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how
I can't seem to understand it

And I would give all this and heaven too
I would give it all if only for a moment
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all

And it talks to me in tiptoes
And it sings to me inside
It cries out in the darkest night and breaks in the morning light

He doesn't build ships, he has no use for sails
He doesn't make tables, dressers or chairs
He can't carve a whistle 'cause he just doesn't care
My boy builds coffins for the rich and the poor
Kings and queens, they've all knocked on his door
Beggars and liars, gypsies and thieves
They all come to him 'cause he's so eager to please

[Chorus]
My boy builds coffins, he makes them all day
But it's not just for work and it isn't for play
He's made one for himself, one for me too
One of these days, he'll make one for you
For you, for you, for you

[Verse 2]
My boy builds coffins for better or worse
Some say it's a blessing, some say it's a curse
He fits them together in the sunshine or rain
Each one is unique, no two are the same
My boy builds coffins and I think it's a shame
That when each one's been made, he can't see it again
He crafts every one with love and with care

Never really been alive before
I always lived in my head
And sometimes it was easier
Hungover and half-dead

[Chorus]
I'm back in town, why don't we go out?
Let the rats spin around our feet
The full moon shines down on these dirty streets
I'm back in town, why don't we go out
To that ninth street diner?
And carry on slowly, torturing each other
'Cause it's always the same

[Post-Chorus]
I came for the pleasure, but I stayed
Yes, I stayed for the pain

[Verse 2]
It's lit up like a movie scene
That halogen glow
And if you get spat on, that's just your big city baptism
You're the star of the show

[Chorus]
I'm back in town, why don't we go out
And never go to sleep?
Throw our dreams out, let them pile up on the streets
I thought that I was here with you
But it was always just an empty room
'Cause it's always the same

[Verse 1]
She can't see the landscape anymore
It's all painted in her grief
All of her history etched out at her feet

Now all of the landscape, it's just an empty place
Acres of longing, mountains of tenderness

[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
Born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
Because it's burning through the bloodline
It's cutting down the family tree
Growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me

[Verse 2]
She wants the silence, but fears the solitude
She wants to be alone and together with you
So she ran to the lighthouse, hoped that it would help her see
She saw that the lighthouse had been washed out to sea

When your life is over

I'll kiss you once for life
I'll kiss you twice for death
Hold you close for comfort

So I will smooth your furrowed brow
As I lay you in the ground

And as the mourners pass me

But once the wake is over
And I'm drunk and feeling fine

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
And I've been a fool and I've been blind (I've been blind)
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound-sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground-ground
I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

Shake it out, shake it out (Oh whoa)

Created and torn apart

Before they go to bed

Baked within their bread

'Cause they put crosses on the doors to try and keep me out

Except the moon still bright
Against the worrying sky

So tell me where to put my love
Do I wait for time to do what it does?

And when it came, it was stranger than I had ever imagined
No cracking open of Heaven
But quiet and still
All my friends are getting ill

So tell me where to put my love

Makes it easier to bear

When they dressed me and they put me on a plane to Memphis, well
I never got to see Elvis
I just sweated it out in a motel room
But I think the king would've understood
Why I never made it to Graceland
Bathroom tiles were cool against my hand
I pressed my forehead to the floor and I prayed for a trapdoor
I've been here many times before
But I've never made it to Graceland

[Chorus: Florence Welch & Ethel Cain]
And if I make it to the mornin'
I shoulda come with a warnin'
And if I make it to the stage
I'll show you what it means
To be saved

Well, pick me up in New Orleans
Pinned in a bathroom stall
Pick me up above my body
Press my corpse against the wall
I told the band to leave without me
I, I'll get the next flight
And I'll see you all with Elvis

And left me doing laundry to think on what I'd done

Everybody wants to be famous
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless
People act shameless, tryna live like entertainers
Want a fat crib with the acres
So they spend money that they ain’t made yet
Got a Benz on tik that they ain’t paid yet
Spend their pay cheque in the West End on the weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend
But they don’t care 'cause thеir life is a movie
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly
Truthfully, it’s a joke, likе a bad episode of Hollyoaks
Can’t keep up with the cover notes
So they got bad credit, livin’ on direct debit in debt
They still don’t get it
'Cause they too busy livin’ the high life, the night life
Huggin’ the high when livin’ it large and they all say

[Chorus: Florence Welch, Dizzee Rascal]
Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do (That's right)
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you’ve got the love I need to see me through

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Check it, yo, let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude’s bad and the weather is–
Everybody’s on a paper chase, it’s one big rat race
Everybody's got a screw face, so many two-face
Checkin' their high just like they're ready to ride
I’m on the inside looking at the–
So it’s an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the south side
Everywhere, I go there’s a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs 'cause the city’s like a sauna

Yo, we're living in the days of the credit crunch
Give me the dough, I’m tryna have a bunch
But I can't have rice for lunch
It's not there, ain't enough to share
It ain't fair, never dreamed that he could be rare
Who cares, who dares to make a change?
Everybody's in the club trying to make it rain
But not for famine, just for the sake of having
15 minutes of fame and everywhere’s the same
Again and again, I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they their plane sailin’
But I see rough seas ahead, maybe a recession
And then a depression in whatever profession
This is my confession, I can’t front, I’m in the forefront
Living for money, ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope, but I ain’t tryna see the bottom
Because that's where I came from, I ain’t forgotten

Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool, and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight, I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

In some dreaming state
A tourist in the waking world
Never quite awake

And no kiss, no gentle word
Can wake me from this slumber
Until I realized
That it was you who held me under

Felt it in my fist, in my feet, in the hollows of my eyelids
Shaking through my skull, through my spine

He can't carve a whistle because he just doesn't care

Beggars and liars, gypsies and thieves
They all come to him because he's so eager to please

But it's not just for work and it isn't for play

One for me too
One of these days he'll make one for you
For you, for you, for you

My boy builds coffins for better or worse
Some say it's a blessing, some say it's a curse
He fits them together in sunshine or rain
Each one is unique, no two are the same

That when each one's been made, he can't see it again

Florence + the Machine,Shake It Out (Benny Benassi Remix),"3 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsShake It Out (Benny Benassi Remix) Lyrics[Intro]
Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Verse 1]
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn

[Chorus]
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
Shake it out, shake it out
Shake it out, shake it out, oh whoa
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, shake him off, shake him off, shake him off

And I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Bridge]
And it's hard to dance
With a devil on your back (Shake him off)
And given half the chance
Would I take any of it back? (Shake him off)
It's a fine romance
But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)
(Shake him off) It's always darkest before the dawn

[Breakdown]
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (Oh woah)
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me (Oh woah)
But, what the hell, I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah

Florence + the Machine,South London Forever (Acoustic),"2 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsSouth London Forever (Acoustic) Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I go home alone
I drive past the place where I was born
And the places that I used to drink
Young and drunk and stumbling in the street
Outside the Joiners Arms like foals unsteady on their feet
With the art students and the boys in bands
High on E and holding hands with someone that I just met

[Refrain]
I thought, ""It doesn't get better than this
There can be nothing better than this, better than this""

[Verse 2]
And we climbed onto the roof of the museum
And someone made love in the grass
And I forgot my name
And the way back to my mother's house
With your Blackpool eyes and your bitten lips
The world is at your fingertips

[Refrain]
It doesn't get better than this
What else could be better than this?

[Chorus]
Oh, do you know what I have seen?
I have seen the fields aflame
And everything I ever did
Was just another way to scream your name

But did I dream too big? Do I have to let it go?
And what if one day there is no such thing as snow?

This is a song called ""Girls Against God""

[Verse 1]
What a thing to admit
That when someone looks at me with real love
I don't like it very much
Kinda makes me feel like I'm bein' crushed
Is this something that you would like to discuss?

[Chorus]
And it's good to be alive
Crying into cereal at midnight
If they ever let me out, I'm gonna really let it out
I listen to music from 2006 and feel kind of sick
But, oh God, you're gonna get it
You'll be sorry that you messed with this

[Verse 2]
Remember being in that basement with Tom Vek?
Everyone treated us like little pets
Oh, tell me it's not over yet
And in my darkest fantasies
I am the picture of passivity
Waitin' for you side of stage
Suppressing all my private rage
But as my sister said, I'd probably last six days

Passion Pit,Take a Walk,"56 ContributorsTake a Walk Lyrics[Verse 1]
All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages
Tomorrow, some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly, I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
Once, I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations
We were still alone, my wife and I
Before we married, saved my money, brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

[Pre-Chorus]
But off the boat, they stayed a while, then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most

[Chorus]
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Practice isn't perfect, but the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions, there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
Once, my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone

We can rip apart those socialists and all their damn taxes
But see I am no criminal, I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward to admit when I'm in need

Passion Pit,Lifted Up (1985),"21 ContributorsLifted Up (1985) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Tell me what does it take to make good now
How many years do you wait?
Oh, and now all of the clouds are combining
The flickering light's just a flame
Oh but yeah, I'm so tired
I've been away for so many years
But I guess I'll just wait a bit longer
I'll stay 'til they open the gates

[Pre-Chorus]
All my life I stay here waiting
Every new year, always making me
Feel as though there's nothing up there but
One day you came out of nowhere

[Chorus]
1985 was a good year
The sky broke apart then you appeared
Dropped from the heavens, they call me a dreamer
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here
Lifted off the ground
I took your hands and pulled you down
Because 1985 was a good year
I won't lie, I knew you would belong here

Beacon, burn through it brightly
Soared through a sliver of space

Passion Pit,Little Secrets,"32 ContributorsLittle Secrets Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I came down the dawn poured into me
I shook em up, the walls came crumbling
My fists kept trembling with these salty wounds
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb
Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Within the confines of such chemistry

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way I see
Everything I need
It's no way to be

[Chorus]
Let this be our little secret
No one needs to know we're feeling
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)
But I feel alive and I feel it in me
Up and up I keep on climbing
(Higher and higher and higher)
(Higher and higher and higher)

The citrus drawing out the season's stains

Watch the basin drain
As your life lines wane
And you can't explain
As your friends complain
You've caused all this pain
And you proudly shame
Your whole family's name

Sorry I couldn't be there
I was tied to a rocking chair
I was beat down to a pulp
Rocking back and forth somewhere
If you knew, if you saw
You'd have said it was the final straw
There my life was bound and tethered
On a porch by the shore

But there is no, no, no, no, no
Easy way to tell one so
The things you know
And run, run, run, run, run
When they say they think they know
Exactly so

[Chorus]
It's not right, it's not right
How am I the only one who sees us fight?
What are we? Who are they?
Who says those bastards don't deserve to pay?
Well it's the numbers, it's the numbers
We don't stand a chance
So long as they're around
You're just another song and dance

For their petty little woes
I used to glow, glow, glow, glow, glow
Once I had a love to show
A love they know

So slow that they never know

Passion Pit,Cry Like a Ghost,"30 ContributorsCry Like a Ghost Lyrics[Verse 1]
Out on my own, where I found you alone
You were caught up in somebody else's mess
And yes, I drank all those drinks on my own
My life's become some blurry little quest
And the clock kept ticking slowly
And you leaned over to ask me
If I even had a clue where I was
Well I lied down on your wood floors
And my brain and body took course
And the night ended as though it never was

[Pre-Chorus]
It all began to feel insane
I wanna know where they keep the rain

[Chorus]
Sylvia, right back where you came from
You're a pendulum, heartbroken and numb, but
Sylvia, no one's gonna tell you when enough's enough
Enough is enough

[Verse 2]
Sick to the bone on the steps to my home
The moon shined through the drapery of leaves
Too hurt to ignore everyone of my own
My true love just to feel some made-up breeze
But as my body crumbled, you walked as I just stumbled
And we spoke only of things made in my head
You never once controlled me, while all the others told me
That if I kept on going, I'd be dead

Now tell me where they keep the rain

See what I've done now, I don't understand
She says I screamed and that I raised my hand, but
I never meant to, wasn't even there
I never meant to, I would never dare

To tell me how to live next to your potpourri

Passion Pit,Love Is Greed,"18 ContributorsLove Is Greed Lyrics[Verse 1]
We want a love, a love for us
We want a selfless love that we can always say we trust, oh
Love has always been a mockery
Of those in love and scared to be lonely
Don't want to love, don't want to hurt
If all that loneliness requires just another's comfort
Better off being all on your own
There's a beauty in being alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Today we're arguing it's not worth making
Another person as just yours for the taking
All your hoping and praying
Won't do more than saying that

Love, love, love
Love is just greed

Until all hope is used up

A smoky figure fills me full
Makes my head swell in ruin

And from my shell of a body
The flowers blossom for picking

Passion Pit,Somewhere Up There,"11 ContributorsSomewhere Up There LyricsBaby, I get so lost
I saw you falling apart and I thought it was all my fault
But now you sing
Oh, how you sing!
With your voice like an angel attached to a broad pair of wings
But that’s the point
Because once we joined
The crowd started screaming and we couldn’t hear over the noise you spoke and said—
(But in my head, I kept passing the blame for excuses to help me tread)

Oh, caught in the middle of deceptions
Just to get a part of the others, our authority figures
That would look like the others
The truths and the liars that were holding us both to the flames
So, now I cry -- I’m only trying to turn our hell to reality
And it’s so divine
Because the pain
And the time it takes to end all of the talking
And finally meet on a plane

And up there somewhere
And up there somewhere


[Spoken]

Waves still crashing, tides of love
Running all our hope, hope
And they crash upon the shores 'til we know

Shot down from under what we never should be
Close to your body, I am taking your lead
But maybe it's the undertow
But I lie, I'll just tell them it's the undertow

Skip through the thick of it and watch as I fill up with the forces that take over me

How it rose, how it feels in the minor
And desires turned major that say you
Ho oh

And take a night or take a day
And time after time it comes to you
How could you barely even choose?
You'll never win and you will not lose
And time after time I will trust you

It bends at the knees and it sends you its feelings
In packages wrapped with your eyes sung and blue
On choosing the answers, you pray till your hands hurt
No, love's not an answer till it ends up all loose

Biding all of the time till we choose you

Passion Pit,I’ve Got Your Number,"8 ContributorsI’ve Got Your Number LyricsI've always felt so scared of all this needing
Everyone that I've met has been somewhat mistreated
That's how it feels when you know that something's wrong

Then you came along like a swan off of the lake
You flew across my eyes and out into space
And I ran and I crawled and I chased to get a taste
That's what I did

If there's just one thing you got to remember
Is to write down your name and your phone number
That way I'll have it and we'll make something out of this mess

And if all else fails then the ship won't set sail
God forbid but I guess the both of us will bail
But as far as I can tell, I think things will be swell

Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster

Like the speed of our love
Batting a thousand but a home-run crack at love
This is where I tell you that
I know love's what I need to work at

With our premonitions out in the gutter
Who would have thought that I'd make it this far?

I'll make it seem like I'm stronger but I'm quite the actor
And now I'm so caught up and I can't escape this pattern
But when I started losing hope, there you were, there you bloomed

Have you seen me cry
Tears like diamonds?
Down and down they fly
Faster and faster

Like the speed of our love
Batting a thousand but a home-run crack at love
This is where I tell you that
I know love's what I need to work at

Everything's always better
Whenever I'm at rest
I'm wound up tighter than
A dried up birds nest
And it's the truth, you know
That's always the issue
But when it starts getting blurry
One's never better than two

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a place in this world
Where people like me are found by people like you
So find a place as this forever divine

[Chorus]
Oh yeah, you're the best damn friend that I'll ever have
You'll always smile upon me when the season's bad
You'll always make me feel best even when I'm blue
You'll always smile upon me and I'll smile upon you too

I don't know what I need now
Since everything has changed
But if I did know one thing
It's me who's feeling strange
'Cause everything is different
And I don't react well
To changes that come when

And I hope you enjoyed it
Now this would be our best song
That you have ever heard
The dirt bike's going on stage
Thank you

[Hook 1]
You're gonna drive me crazy
You're gonna drive me mad
You got an angel on your shoulder
Makin' heavens out of less
[Verse 1]
I believe in believing
The things that we don't see
And the skin violin is where
The neighbors won't read meals

And the family heirloom jewelry
With sets and heaps of thieves
Will cast down things
That you've never ever seen

Like the gods, like the glory, like the stories
That your fathers set before you
Like the tide that overcame you, oh no
Oh no, resonating in the canyons
Oh no, this is rising to the clouds

I swear there's truth in that

[Verse 2]
I'm shooting off the cannons
And the clouds begin to flow
And the baskets weave but the ones heap
Are the ones we'll never keep

Just pretend that things are mobile
And they're never staying put
And the way we were the day
We climbed to the top of the steeple

With it's people spewing angels out their mouths
And letting tables turn to charcoal
In the lipstick and the lipstick in the evening
Oh no, we were waving like the trees
Oh no, then they moved us to the sky
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Two or three times the bell will ring
It's when we look for the better things
We search for this, we all have none

Of these things behind the door
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Do I miss you like you miss me?

It’s a rush then you bring it full stop
Well I never seem to ask
And you never seem to wonder
If it ever seems to be what it’s not

And at the break of dawn, all I do if I’m alone
As the sun eats away all this rot
It’s the shifting of the hands, it’s the shifting of the cards

And your love comes filling right up until it touches the brim
Well the others in the corner keep on blowing it over
Yeah, we’re dancing till we’re in a full spin

Well, if I take just a minute just to feel like we’re in it
For the reasons that I know that we're not
Then the room goes quiet, no I can’t really buy it

What the others seem to think that you’ve got

You got the odds up against you
Stacking high as they can get to
And the room’s so unbearably hot

Well if my love’s just a pill that you popped to make you feel
Like there’s nothing that you have to run from

I take away your self pity and the rush of the city
And we’re off until you’re begging me to come

And it goes on, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on

Passion Pit,Batty Lashes,"4 ContributorsBatty Lashes LyricsYou want to be where the people are living
You want to live where the life is throbbing
You want a friend who can be your lover
You want a lover who can be your friend
Let's get real, you want a man who can make you feel
The way they make you feel when you feel
Like you can't get through
To every single person that's ever mingled with you
You are alive like a Hollywood car chase
You are the one who has a kiss before the credits
I will be as much to you as I can handle
You're worth every single penny and a few dollars more
I'll be true, I want you and only you
There's nobody else that can do all the things you can do
And after all we've been through there is so much to do

Yes it's true
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
Oh yes, you know they do
So I ran away from you
Yes I did, I rode a river of love
It almost took my life, it got so damn rough
It almost threw me overboard, but I held on tight enough
I'd never give up on love
You might also likeIt's when everything is simply disastrous
That our love becomes a beacon of light
And when it all comes together at the end
It makes everything we fought over
Seem that much more trite
God only knows, what the hell we've been fighting for
And all I know is that I need you just like you need me
And that's the way it's gonna stay unconditionally
I'm afraid of all the people crowded 'round my
Life from living with you by my side
You want to catch me swinging back and forth now
My god I hope you won't grow tired of my
Dysfunctional way of existing
I decided it won't be really easy
You gotta trust me when I say thanks for being
The only person who's giving me a break

Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak at the knees (yeah they do)
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak at the knees (yes they do)
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak at the knees
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak at the knees
Oh yes, you know they do
So I ran away from you
Yes I did, I rode a river of love
It almost took my life, it got so damn rough
It almost threw me overboard, but I held on tight enough
I never give up on love
No, I'd never give up on love
I wouldn't give up on love
I wouldn't give up on love
I wouldn't give up on love
Not once, not twice, not three times
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
I wouldn't give up on love at all
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
I wouldn't give up on love at all
Your batty lashes, batty lashes keep me weak in the knees
No, I wouldn't give up on love
Your batty lashes, batty lashes got me weak in the knees
Oh yes, you know they do

Passion Pit,Carry On,"2 ContributorsCarry On Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains
And heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said
We are not
We are not shining stars
This I know
I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows
To know you can never look back

[Chorus]
If you're lost and alone
Or you're sinking like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound
Of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

[Verse 3]
So I met up with some friends
At the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked
About how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think
I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
When I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you want of me

My head is on fire
But my legs are fine
After all they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door
Hold the phone
Show me how
No one's ever gonna stop us now

Cause we are
We are shining stars
We are invincible
We are who we are
On our darkest day
When we're miles away
So we'll come
We will find our way home

Sorry bout the things that I said

Tell me what your point is in defense
Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want to
But I think I can fake it if you can
And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money

Because we stick together, we're just like friends
And nobody else ever tries to hurt us
'Cause I've got friends, I'm sure of that
They just don't seem to call me right back

[Verse 2: Rivers Cuomo]
Honey, whеre did we go wrong?
We wеre like a couple of peas in a pod
And the silent thing is hard
I feel like I've got cotton in my mouth
Don't ask me why I came here
I won't know anyway
I was lonely when I wrote this
But I swear to God, I'm not insane

I shook 'em up, the walls came crumbling
My thin skin trembling with these salty wounds
My stolen gold inside the emperors tomb

Now painting rainbows on my ugly face
I built this cardboard neighborhoods disgrace
But I ascend and serve my feverish need
Within the confines of such chemistry

Little Dragon,Cat Rider,"19 ContributorsCat Rider Lyrics[Verse 1]
Two months ago now
Since she came around this house
Her answering machine's full
He thinks listening could give her doubts
But when this girl's made up her mind
She's made up her mind, made up her mind
Looking out to the horizon
No turnin' back, no wastin' time

[Chorus]
Smooth cat rider
Stop bragging 'cause she broke your facade
Don't we all want to be stars and all?
Stop playing with the one that you love
Smooth cat rider
Stop bragging 'cause it's gone to your head
So smooth, but she was smart instead
Stop playing with the one that you love

[Verse 2]
A fountain in the hall
Big old portraits of himself on the wall
A diamond sculpture face
This peacock is flying all over the place
The tiger's extra claws, no, she's not impressed
Your laughs and stupid jokes, the only thing she missed
Now you can't stop looking back
Leaving messages

Empty bottles, where to go next
Knowing what you truly missed

Can't get out your king-size bed
Now you're left with names to forget
Trying to heal from the pain

Would not have acted the same

Little Dragon,Constant Surprises,"11 ContributorsConstant Surprises Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was walking home, looking at the trees
Got the feeling that they were looking back at me
Thoughts that occurred to me were not of the usual kind
And I don’t take that for granted, no
I don’t call them mine, I don’t call them mine
‘Cause in my life things are built on
They're built on

[Chorus]
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate

[Verse 2]
The higher forces want to connect
Last night in my dream, I was talking to you
You know who you are, were you dreaming too?
‘Cause in my life, things are built on
They're built on

[Chorus]
Constant surprises coming my way
Some call it coincidence, but I like to call it fate
Constant surprises coming my way

You disappeared all of a sudden
But where?
I’ve forgotten to check
To follow the hum and the rain
To follow the drummer
We lie
So in love
But this love is not for everyone
And I’m just draggin’ along
Don’t want it ever to stop

Daylight spring ‘em up along
I did and my work began to go, ooh
And if I ever did you wrong
It’s rain on

Let go of everything I know
I know you’re catchin’ up soon
Sweet nights with June
Let go so the rain may yawn
We’re spoiled and brave on here, I'm here?

Do you feel so immortal?
So real?
Pushing under the rain
Feeling thunder and pain
Oh, I’ve forgotten to follow the drum

And there's nothing left to breath in

Long as I see fire in the night sky

Crossing country, looking for a real job
Nothing seems to suit me, no
Guess I'll keep doing what I did before

In a desert fire
Saving nothing from the past

In darkness I feel snug
Turn me into lightning bug

Glowing in the dark
Finding streams of stars to taste
Roll me out like moonlight
On a still, black, lonesome lake
Taken in by the night
Empty, elevated place
Glowing in the dark to find the streams of stars to taste

By the way I wish I'd been
There for you
When the northern lights
Got brighter

Yet, it was not like that
Not like that

I found myself breathing fire
There's just one way to cure my heart from you
'Cause I can't let go, I'm still loving you so

Go run about the streets like it's a race
Go run about, run about
Oh, with the perfect plan you play with
What you can and run about

This fever caught me in the rush
There's just one way to cure my heart from you
Because I can let go, I'm still loving you so

Little Dragon,Twice (Mixed),"3 ContributorsTwice (Mixed) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Twice I turned my back on you
I fell flat on my face, but didn't lose
Tell me, where would I go?
Tell me, what led you on? I'd love to know

[Chorus]
Was it the blue night gone fragile?
Was it about the men in wonder steady going under?
Was it the light ways, so frightening?
Was it a two wills? One mirror holding us dearer now

[Verse 2]
Thought I had an S.O. once
But your random away swept me along
Colossal signs so I got lost
With so many lovers singing songs

[Chorus]
Was it the blue night gone fragile?
Was it about the men in wonder steady going under?
