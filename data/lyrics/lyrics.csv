Tame Impala,The Less I Know the Better,"162 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsItalianoDeutschThe Less I Know the Better Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise, leanin' on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

[Verse 2]
She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever""
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Givin' in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want? Is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
All sweet talkin', where he wants ya
So, come on, Superman, say your stupid line
So, come on, Superman, say your stupid line

Tame Impala,"New Person, Same Old Mistakes","106 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoFrançaisDeutschفارسیEspañolNew Person, Same Old Mistakes Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried, but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
I know…
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
I know there's too much at stake
Making the same mistakes
And I still don't know why it's happening
Stop while it's not too late
And I still don't know…

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinkin' in black and white
Thinkin' it's worth the fight
Soon I'll be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
So how do I know I've gone too far?
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late

[Bridge]
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
[Chorus]
Feel like a brand-new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
Feel like a brand-new person
I finally know what it's like
Stop thinking that the only option was…
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
And I know it's hard to describe
Stop thinking that the only option was…
So how will I know that it's right?118Embed"

It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
""Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen""

[Chorus]
All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning

[Verse 2]
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

[Chorus]
All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my take-off fails, make up some other story
But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry

I was raging, it was late
In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once
Yes, I'm changing, yes, I'm gone
Yes, I'm older, yes, I'm moving on
And if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along with me
Life is moving, can't you see?
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby, now there's nothing left that

[Chorus]
I can do
So don't be blue
There is another future waiting there for you

[Verse 2]
I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change but that's bullshit, they do
Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted, I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there and it's calling my name
And it's calling yours, girl, it's calling

Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make, that makes you cry
I'm as pathetic, as the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I got for you (Uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware, not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride

I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which is standard for me, Thursday, 12:30
I've got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know, it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving, I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rear-view mirror
But, in its reflection, just for a second
I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories flooded back, stopped me in my tracks
""Who was that?"" It was my lover
A lover from a past life

[Chorus]
From a past life
Feel like I saw a ghost
From a past life
So unexpected
From a past life
I was transfixed
From a past life

[Interlude]
Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal, poetic but uncertain
Like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to black out regret

It takes a lot to trip me out

So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on, but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

From a past life
I guess there's no harm in trying
From a past life
What's the worst that could happen?

For the first time
In a long time

To watch her airplane swaying, coming in to land
There, my world is hanging, in someone else's hands

Think of me as someone, someone that you know
But if I don't hear something, pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect completely, see how that works out

Oh, my darling, why won't you answer?

Save your fragile mama's heart
And while she will come for you

For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end, I wander
Still I don't even know her

Asking how I managed to end up

Of pain and rapture

He’s got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now

‘Cause he doesn’t like it looking

But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fucking doubt I make unleash a cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

Don't always think before I do

I am aware I'm not in control
I have a conscience that is nеver fooled
But it's prone to bе overruled

I can't even concentrate on this
It's over-thought, anticipated
The pen ink is running dry
It's been thrown to paper and wasted
Creativity has been blocked and over-tasted
Maybe in time I'll appreciate it

[Chorus]
Hold on, hold on
We'll be with you soon

[Verse 2]
These papers are stuck in this book
Until they're torn out and pasted
To the inside of my memory
Where I can later look and see them in a new gallery
Where they can later be
Viewed and appreciated

[Chorus]
Hold on, hold on
We'll be with you soon

Lift your anchor
And just float astray
Born into silence

While fragments of irony's examples fly
And hit the shore
And tyranny's torn
From the podiums where leaders stand ...
But rule no more

Plead with nothing
Why don't we lecture about something?
Protest the way
We're passive today

Oblivious though
Unified clones
Sit like stones
Up on thrones
Of fool's gold
Looking bold
But all alone

Restore our needed shelter

Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Pants at my knees
Fading with growth
Lie awake
Buried stones
All alone

Restore our needed shelter
Our flawless endeavor
To be alone
To be alone

Wading water

Lately I haven't meet my expectations
Destroy this

Fighting for space
Peace is unattainable
Everywhere is the same place
Nothing is sustainable
There's no one left to embrace
Peace is unattainable
Everyone has the same face
Nothing is sustainable

I have been led by addiction
Lately I have been in a state of contradiction
Destroy this
I have acted out of selfish pleasures
From these I have gone to drastic measures
Destroy this

Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?

So goodbye

Or see it from this way 'round

One by one, every trait

All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late

Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)

Making the same mistakes
And I still don't know why it's happening
Stop while it's not too late

Tame Impala,’Cause I’m a Man,"91 ContributorsTranslationsEspañol’Cause I’m a Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make, that makes you cry
I'm as pathetic, as the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I got for you (Uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware, not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you, no way
I always thought heroes stayed close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes

[Verse 2]
Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself

[Chorus]
Did you think I'd never know?
Never wise up as I grow?

And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still had time, you had a chance
But you decided to take all your sorrys to the grave

I may not be as honest as I ought to be
Now that, when the walls go up
I said it didn't worry me but it hit me like an arrow
Babe, to know, I could just be paranoid
Won't quell the desire to know what was really going on
""Does it really fucking matter, babe?"" is all you can ask me
Okay, fair play, here we go

[Verse 2]
I've heard those words before
Are you sure it was nothing
'Cause it made me feel like dying inside
Never thought I was insecure, but it's pure
Didn't notice until I was in love for real
Am I really gonna cross the line
Just to find what you're typing?
If only I could read your mind
Ooh, I'd be fine, I'd be normal
But now’s my time, gonna do it

[Verse 3]
And suddenly I'm the phony one
The only one with a problem
True love is bringing it out of me
The worst in me, and I know now
Do you remember the time we were
The time we were by the ocean?

Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it

Too bad your chances are slim

To get shy when they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down in the dark down there
But he's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs

I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which is standard for me, Thursday, 12:30
I've got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know, it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving, I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rear-view mirror
But, in its reflection, just for a second
I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories flooded back, stopped me in my tracks
""Who was that?"" It was my lover
A lover from a past life

[Chorus]
From a past life
Feel like I saw a ghost
From a past life
So unexpected
From a past life
I was transfixed
From a past life

[Interlude]
Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal, poetic but uncertain
Like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to black out regret
But it was real, it just feels like a past life

So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on, but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

[Chorus]
From a past life
I guess there's no harm in trying
From a past life
What's the worst that could happen?
(I always wondered if you wanted my love)
For the first time
In a long time
(I tried to say it but it never came out right)
Past life
From a past life

Doesn't like sand stuck on her feet
Or sittin' around smokin' weed

Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
But now I worry our horizons bear nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim
Has slowly become all we do

It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Saying, ""It's so obvious""
But really, they don't know (They don't know)
Just like a monster that is (Man or machine)
Only a shadow (A shadow)
From which I'm already runnin'

[Verse 2]
Easy, I suppose
And even if it takes
A hundred-thousand goes
The way's in front of me 'cause
That's the one I chose (I chose)
It's always starin' at you (Barely a choice)
That's the boat I row (I row)
And though it seems to be

[Chorus]
Endless problems
Relentless
I know I'm oblivious
Bit overzealous
And possibly jealous
I run till I'm breathless
Try to suppress it
I couldn't bear it, so onward, I go

To hide in the night
And blink at the door
You'd let it go
Though you'll never know
When it all may be gone
We close our heart
We shut down our world
To rumors you know
Tore down the shield
Your future reveals
Where the feel's yet to go

You've gotta open up your mind and feel the love in your life
You've got to open up your heart feel the love in your life
You've gotta open up your mind and feel the love in your life
You've got to open up your heart feel the love in your life
Love in your lifer heart
And feel love in the light

They won't decide
Watch time glassing by
Then float away
You can't get ill
Just typewrite on in
To the rows we could play
Dissatisfied
You always have tried
To divert with goodbyes
Though what you seek
Who knows it could be
Right in front of your eyes

Tame Impala,Stranger In Moscow,"5 ContributorsStranger In Moscow LyricsI was wandering in the rain (Mask of life, feelin' insane)
Swift and sudden fall from grace (Sunny days seem far away)
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me (Stalin's tomb won't let me be)
On and on and on it came

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame (Armageddon of the brain)
KGB was doggin' me (Take my name and just let me be)
Then a begger boy called my name (Happy days will drown the pain)
On and on and on it came

Thank you guys
Hey, uh, give it up for White Denim
Holy moly, what a-what a bunch of freakishly good musicians
They make us look like novices
Alright
Let's see if we can prove our musical prowess
On this song, called ""Half A Glass of Wine""
Go crazy, Chicago

[Verse 1]
Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine

[Pre-Chorus]
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
Leave me no choice but to plot my revenge

[Chorus]
It's been so long
Since I've held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be

Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge running low
I tried to fill but it overflowed

Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong

She remembers my name
Could be blown way out
It's all going to change
She remembers my name

But she was only messing around
Please, no more playing with my heart
Ooh, go with Mr. Right just for once
Ooh, no more mischief with my mind

​dredg,Planting Seeds,"2 ContributorsPlanting Seeds LyricsShe's to blame, I'll erase routine
With a spark to ignite the flame
And in this struggle of guilt to tame
It's freedom I'll obtain
She tied me up, removed my crown
Bittered all good taste
I'm sorry for everything I've done
I can't deny instinct

Look what I have found
A seashell in a sea of shells
I'm good at planting my own seeds
To sprout an endless hell
It's dark like Poe

Forgiveness came, we embrace the key
Found water to douse the flame
We ended our difference of soul and brain
Forever we are changed
I've just set out on a brand new race
Can we keep the pace
I can't believe what we've become
I'll leave without a trace

Are the circular memories
Infect your conscience
They are the make up of your worries
Regrets and doubts

Elective betrayal of your person
Radiates confidence
Shine with silence
And shadow the ones below

This drought is leaving me
With cracked soil and brown leaves
Floating on a dry lake bed
With a dry mouth and a foggy head
Waiting for the snow
When the water comes
I will overflow
I will overflow
And when the water comes
I will overflow

There's one more thing
I forgot to tell you
Worries and doubts
Will only help you
In the long run
You'll shadow the ones below

For once I held you tight, but shadowed arms grabbed at me
Your head was in the clouds, now those clouds are in your head
It's when you needed me, so I listened to what you said

Look another year went by
They keep passing by
God damn I didn't even die
Too old and slow I've grown
Well I fought time, but lost

It was love like a callus you're scarred enough to be
Tough and immune, my body adapts you see
To all above my head and all below my feet
Know that's one freedom you'll never take from me

Look another year went by

Well I fought time, but lost

With nothing but a stool to hold up his back

Unaware of his surroundings

Swarming like wolves to a fresh kill

I can understand to a certain extent
The camaraderie and mass appeal
But the feelings you hold
You got 'em under control
Make me realize how much you have grown
I can understand what you meant
That very few could even deal
With the passable delivery you've shown
Make me realize you're on your own
You're on your own

[Chorus]
I can lie, I can lie if it makes you feel better
I can lie, I can lie if it gives you pleasure
You'll be fine, you'll be fine if we do it together
But, I can lie, I can lie if it makes you feel better

[Post-Chorus 1]
Please know I'll be here when you return

[Verse 2]

Traveled up and down these roads
Had to adventure out and become a man
Started in a familiar place
But ended up in a foreign land
But as the story usually goes
Nothing quite went as planned

[Chorus]
He was on an endless road, feeling like a king
Even after the initial bite, the wound still did sting
It's not an easy thing to deal with, even for the toughest man
It was already over before it began
It was already over before it began

[Verse 2]
The same strut was in his walk
The same fire was in his eye
Before his child was even born
He'd already said his goodbyes

[Chorus]
He was on an endless road, feeling like a king
Even after the initial bite, the wound still did sting

Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
(Hoo, yeah, haha)
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head
[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines 'til they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

Got 'em 'round town, could've drowned in it
Would have floated, bloated, voted

Draw for the poor, free coffee at the banks
Hit through the straw, none more for me, thanks
That blanks the raw, that dank sure stank lit
Sank past the pit for more hardcore prank spit
Crank it on blast, roll past Front Street
Blew the whole spot like some old ass with skunk meat
These kids is too fast, juiced off a junk treat
Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

[Verse 1: slowthai & 2-D]
Your potential, you lack credentials
And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)
Oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
And you keep squeezing the tube from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You part the seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)
And you was gagging for some gags so now you're rolling (Woo)
Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)
On another note, compliments make me blush
There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
Cavern of your mind, you say you're patterned
You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say (Ah, ah, ah)
""What was scripted, the day before it happened?""
We all give applause when people open doors
But on the way out it did your back in
See, everything in life ain't silver and gold
But mining for metal gave you platinum

It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin

Where you gotta bite the bounty 'cause everybody taking it

I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
A shadow in the corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if I get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say ""I'm leaving"" to you
You've got a folding chair, and you don't know what to do
You'd sigh

You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doing, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)

And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)

I’m impregnable, incredible, and set in the quo
I’m a late in my rider, not a heart and soul
I got a Saturday night, and nothing is dead
And if I ever had to do it, well, you know I wouldn’t care
I just get down, I love when I’m seen
And if I wanna talk back, the message is free
Then there’s a fire, a ray, a knot in sight
And if you get my tip, you get 'em a lot

Gorillaz,Fire Coming Out of the Monkey’s Head,"93 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiPortuguêsNederlandsРусскийFire Coming Out of the Monkey’s Head Lyrics[Verse 1: Dennis Hopper]
Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here, they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses
But no one noticed them, they only saw shadows
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind

[Interlude: 2D]
Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump out from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

[Verse 2: Dennis Hopper]
In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
Its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep
And then came a sound, distant first, that grew into castrophany
So immense that it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called Monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then... nothing

To grow a made-up paradise
Where the truth was auto-tuned (Forever cult)

Here is our tree
That primitively grows
And when you go to bed
Scarecrows from the far east
Come to eat its tender fruits
And I thought the best way to perfect our tree
Is by building walls
Walls like unicorns
In full glory and galore
And even stronger
Than the walls of Jericho
But glad then my friend
Out in the field, we shall reap a better day
What we have always dreamt of having
Are now for the starving
It is love, that is the root of all evil
But not our tree
And thank you, my friend
For trusting me

Hello, hello
Please leave all your belongings at the door
You can sit or stand, we can take a vote
And just tiptoe to the centre of the circle
While we unveil the ropes
Still a little room left to hang your clothes
Some of us are new here, we'll take it slow
Ready, set, go
I lock hands with yours
We dive into the floor (drop)
When we reach the core
Then we stomp some more (drop)
I lock hands with yours
And then we dive down into the floor
Seven thousand miles 'til we reach the core
And then we circle back and we stomp some more, got it?
It's just like that
You promise all your life, then you turn your back
You glide across the space, and diagonal past
Then you kick, and you jump, and you arch your back
You move your hips and your arms like a cat
Spin three times, and you're back where you're at
Does anybody catch what any of this is about?
No? Well, work it out

In demon days, it's cold inside
You don't get nobody, people sigh
It's so bad, lasting far, but love yourself
Hiding in a hole in there
All the glasses are far too big
Bring it back, got to hold it back
To let you do that, yet you don't want me back
Before it fall down, falling down, falling down
Falling down to go far from the sun
[Chorus: The London Community Gospel Choir]
In these demon days, we're so cold inside
It's so hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth want us all to leave
When lies become reality
You numb yourself with drugs and TV
Pick yourself up, it's a brand new day
So turn yourself 'round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around to the sun
In these demon days, we're so cold inside
It's so hard for a good soul to survive
You can't even trust the air you breathe
'Cause Mother Earth wants us all to leave
When lies become reality
You numb yourself with drugs and TV
Pick yourself up, it's a brand new day
So turn yourself 'round
Don't burn yourself, turn yourself
Turn yourself around into the sun

But in the magic cove, there's a pretty one
I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want
I wonder if she knows that we're underwater
That's the way it goes in this city wonder

[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Moved to the spot, I'm one of a few
A whole lot of everything, but nothin' to do
Tilted in a Tesla, partner, ex-wrestler
He dates Francesca, they on the Xannies
Liposuction schedulеd for Granny
She want to save some, add to hеr fanny
Girls' trip, Miami at the end of the year
Polluted-filled skies, tryin' to think clear
I heard the bad news while I was sheddin' a beer
Watch out from the coast, Paul Revere
We all play a part in the devil's cheer
Run to the hills 'cause the end is near

I asked her where it goes 'cause I really want

Gave ourselves a handout when it's too much to bear

Like Shaun, he's a Ryder, took on the dare
Now he's singin' like a birdy, pullin' on his hair

Friendship's here, but now fuckin' revolving door

Bullshit keeps comin', maybe I'm a matador

And your heart engages into heartless throes

They breathe you in

Just tryna keep my head straight
On thin ice with the ice skates
At times, I feel like givin' up
'Cause it feels like I've had enough
Felt like my soul in handcuffs
Got questions with no answers
Can't help me out, I need a friend
I'm losin' faith in this world of sin
Tryna make ends meet with a week, no sleep
It's like a cycle that never ends
I can't contend with no handlin'
I can't take care of no grown man
All by myself, cryin' for help
But won't get saved by no Superman
All comes down to the mighty dollar
Greed and lust, abusin' power
Clock is tickin', hour after hour
Makes me wanna throw my hands and holler

That juicy fruit, that splooshy sploosh
Generation X on bloopty-bloop
Get doop, gotta get doopty doop
Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney, I commend me

But y'all rap a lot, and I'm like wrap it up, ho

Dare a nigga say something, tear a nigga face off

From the winter wonderland, catching out
The bees hiding in the grounds, no future Batman

And mommy ain't said ""Honey, I shrunk the kids"" yet
I ain't Jesus, but I'm walking on water
There's no bombs here, there's no war, 'cause
I can break out of jail with a lighter
So is there any point in making laws, blud?

No rain, condoms, it poured
And up the road, you'd never guess who I saw!

Look, no feds, no stress, no rent

Where the women look hot, but the beach cold
And the speech goes like, ""Hi, little lady
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby?""

Spinning around the world at night
Spin round in black and white
Spinning around until the sun comes up
Strange time to see the light

[Verse 1: 2-D]
I think I've fallen onto silken thread, my head is spinning
Suspended in a twilight web that keeps on giving
The looping dervish in the lodge is lost within the ringing
Far away, I can hear the sound of someone out there singing
I'm speeding through the forest, strange echoes of Belarus
Where presidents pin badges on disconnected youths
What will you be dreaming of? No horseplay, no diving
Cutting grass with scissors, whilst the great leaders reclining
In the golden hallways where we spin, the faithful will be silent

When the light shines through it I feel more exposed
Will it ever change here? We'll just never know

See the time is of the essence and this clock doesn't own a home
Rain falls from the heavens to my palace rooftop
When the light shines through I feel more exposed

In tune, with myself on it, my mind is my weakness
With your strength, you might surprise yourself
Never deny yourself, I live in the space is my thesis
I know you need this, I know you need this
I'm prone to run out of pieces
That might connect to something bigger
All in your mind, could follow me, you should consider
Look at the time, I'm probably later than ever
""What did you find?"" Well come in here, and lit it with pressure
I look to the heavens and I saw open gates
I walked up and then I paused
What the fuck did you do this for?
Wish me luck when that midnight falls

If my whole purpose here wasn't to speak
Now look at the time, I know that I am early today
What did you find when giving up and running away?
I gazed to the stars and this view can't be shared
When there are no other eyes in this room
Mean the words when you sing your tune
Free as a bird when I intake fumes

And late in a star's life
It begins to explode
And all the people in a dream
Wait for the machine
To pick the shit up, leave it clean
Kid, hang over here

Gonna be good for everyone?

Better look sharp, now your face on the cover
Like a chameleon, see you change in your color
Crabs in the barrel, wanna hate on each other
Saw my life gets better, whatever the weather
I dance in the rain and I bathe in summer

It's the black Corleone in a button-up shirt
Before we take off you better buckle up first
Fresher than the President, psychedelics got me in my element
All negativity, that's irrelevant
Amber Leaf or ganja leaf, I backstrap when I wrap the sheets
Now I feel to go for a drive, so I grab my keys
Shades on, roof down, tryna catch a breeze
Ride around the hood, got the devil in my ear
Can you smell that? Smells like jealousy in the air
Dunno who they're tryna scare
Looked at the man in the mirror, that's the only enemy that I fear
A zombie knows who to frighten
Just know I love the action, but I move in silence
And, right now I'm just takin' what's mine

A suit for the wedding and a suit for the court case
Probably wear the same suit to the funeral
Tryna see the bigger picture, man, it's bigger than the portrait
Bigger than me, no, you can't fight off your demons with vitamin C
Have to open your mind, use your vision and see
Keep your eyes on the prize so vigilantly
Love how you live, remember the world full of expensive shit
Can't forget the poor 'cause you're friends with the rich

Been so long since I been okay
I met a lady on the side of the road
And her eyes were a story that had never been told
About a life that was lived on hope
And the truth of the inner light that we all hold
She said ""Baby, I can hear my train coming

Listen child, don't you ever waste time tryna dim nobody shine

""Yo. Yo. Yo.""
Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted
I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed
My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics
I'm a lyrical misfit with the sadistic characteristics
I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath
And if a boy wanna phi test, then I be stampin' upon his chest
Done makin' a mess - Not a man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'
And I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human
I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out
And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout
That's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
And I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page
I take you back to the stone age with Barney and Fred Flintstone
Get Dino to tear your Moschinos and then force you to limp home

[Life]
I'mma take off like a jet pack with the get back, rather step back
I'mma make the crowd react and nod they heads until they neck snap
I can flip raps while riding a skateboard and doin' a tic-tac
And leave your head in a spin like starin' at turn table skid mats
I'm a concrete lion, big cat - this is real talk, not big-chat
Did ya get that, cause I ain't no small timer - I rhyme on big tracks
Now fell the vibes I create, this heavy weight, I'm about to detonate
And demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate
To the top of my lyrics escalate, accelerate and leave you panickin'
Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins
My style is totally buckwild and most definitely happenin'
To your brains I be tappin' in, to computers I be hackin' in
To me, I be out of this world like aliens who were time travelin'
I'm dabblin' in the Fists of Fury technique when I speak
Forget Karate Kid and these wooden blocks, I chop through concrete
Concrete, concrete, concrete!
Wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha!

Guess my head just left the building
Like out the window, missed the ceiling
I cannot explain this feeling
I never learned to speak a zillion
Now I'm stuck, my body left me bleedin' (Severed head)
Roll the train, it's passing fast, it's speeding outside
My body gone, don't need the soul, ey
Just take another breathe or so, ey
Found on my torso
I mean my neck go, but where did my heart go?
I mean my leg go, but where did my mind go?
I guess I only gotta go where the body goes

E sabe que eu sou moleque-problema, vai
Toma lá, toma cá, tenta vim pra trocar

Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a genie
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B
Cause this one's for your radios over, do you receive me?
Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya
We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his manger
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls
We've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol
See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo

[Chorus: 2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude

And they called onto me

Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your course
Cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so appealing

I know you're hearin' me cause my voice is clearer than crystal

To rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor

We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours
So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down

From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound
On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat

It's starting to pour
Why don't we get out in it and dance on the pavement? (Yeah)
Abandon your wars
The sky and thunder and lightning and rain are innocent
It's tipping down, I can't see
But I'm not really caring 'cause I'm dancing on the pavement
Oh, say, can you see?
The sky and thunder and lightning and heaven's open for us

[Chorus: 2-D]
Shut in, don't know, no, no, to be shut in
Don't know, not meant to be shut in
Don't know, camera, sicken, now come, you're alive, oh
It's taking me out (Simplicity)

[Verse: 2-D]
Night time and I go smooth some off
(Little bit of news)
Negative, now it's red and I
Chime in strong
(Little bit of news)
Are you ever really lost?
You cutting cardboard
Watchers waiting, we had names
We had suspects, but a boxset caught your eye
And I was forgotten, I was forgotten
I am the architect of this delusion
The burgeoning load, one billion
These are amazing times
The past is a place where rockets take off
What now, a burnished plaque

Gorillaz,The Book of Noodle,"2 ContributorsThe Book of Noodle LyricsDays after the attack on Plastic Beach, Noodle awoke in a strange Japanese village that smelled of fish. It was a fishing village. She'd been nursed back to health by an old pearl diver named Chiyoko, so to repay her kindness, Noodle took a job as her apprentice.

She was a natural (having shared a tour bus with Murdoc, she was really good at holding her breath). But one day, deep beneath the waves, Noodle prized open a pearl shell of unearthly size, accidentally releasing an ancient hell demon. It scarpered, ready to party like it's 1499.

Noodle learned that this was Maazu, a shapeshifting devil of unimaginable evil, that could take human form. It had to be destroyed. To do so, she must remove its head from its body. Or the other way around.

But finding a shapeshifter is like looking for a beard at an Arcade Fire concert. For years, Noodle pursued Maazu across Japan, from the heights of Mt Fuji to the deepest, darkest forests. Finally, she tracked Maazu to Tokyo, where it had risen to the top of the criminal underworld.

Disguising herself as a geisha, Noodle infiltrated its debauched headquarters, The Demon's Lodge. And there, while Maazu was distracted by a heated bout of 'Drink While You Think', she lopped off its head. His earthly existence was over. And the carpet was ruined.
Escaping Mazuu's Sumo bodyguards, Noodle packed herself into a FedEx crate with dried fish, bottled water and a copy of Moby Dick - if she was ever to finish Melville's onerous classic, it was now.

Her package was addressed: West London, England - c/o Murdoc Niccals.Embed"

Gorillaz,The Book of 2D,"4 ContributorsThe Book of 2D LyricsDuring the pirate attack on Plastic Beach, 2D hid in his underwater quarters. Unwittingly he'd made himself prey to a far fiercer foe: a great white whale known as Massive Dick (weirdly, no relation to Moby). The blubbery beast swallowed 2D in one bite, and swam into the deep.

But a lifetime spent eating ocean garbage – and now 2D – took its toll on Massive, and he died. His carcass washed up on a desert island, where 2D was finally free... to die of starvation, due to a total lack of survival skills. Unable even to catch crabs (which was more Murdoc's forte), 2D had no option but to eat his former host. Rancid whale blubber for breakfast, lunch and dinner. With a side of sand.

Several months later, 2D spotted a plane flying along the coast. Moved to tears by this beacon of hope, he set off in its direction. Twenty-three minutes later he was in the middle of a full-scale beach rave. It turns 2D wasn't marooned at all. He had in fact landed on Guadalupe, off the Mexican coast. 2D joined the beach party, ate some strange-tasting brownies, and came third in the wet T-shirt contest.

As he claimed his prize, 2D had a eureka moment. He would have a gap year and find himself. It turned out finding himself was really easy – he was right there. But he stayed the rest of the year anyway, until he got sacked from his job weaving friendship bracelets. It was time to fly home.

At Heathrow, a man at arrivals held up a sign saying 'Wanker'. 2D followed him to his car, which drove him to West London, where he was reunited with Murdoc, Russel and Noodle. Gorillaz were back.1Embed"

Every dead body that is not exterminated becomes one of them. It gets up and kills! The people it kills get up and kill!

[Sample from ""Dawn of the Dead""]
""Why is it?""

""Because they still believe there´s respect.""

""Hello Captain.""

[Simultaneously with Verse 1]
""The normal question, the first question is always; are these cannibals? No, they are not cannibals. Cannibalism in the true sense of the word implies an interspecies activity. These creatures cannot be considered human. They prey on humans. They do not prey on each other! That's the difference. They attack and they feed only on warm human flesh.""

If you have any checked bags, they will be brought to the front of the station
To get to the front, walk down to the south end of the platform and cross left at the crosswalk
That'll put you right in front of the depot
Look for a sign that says ""baggage claim""
You should have your claim check handy to show the clerk
Give them a few minutes to get your bags to the front
If anyone is in need of a ride to the front of the station
Red Cap service will be provided on the platform
We do have one group that is going to go first
If you do need Red Cap service to arrive at the front
They will come back and pick you up on the platform and take you to the front of the station
Taxi cabs are located on the center boulevard in front of the depot

These are my friends, um, I've actually met these guys in, erm, Lidl in, uh, in Shoreditch and we had a fight over the last stollen, I said, ""Look, let's just split the stollen"", and we started chatting about things and then he said ""Um, um, I'm in this band called Slaves"". And I said ""Um, I'm in a band and do you wanna come hang out and do a little bit of work with us?"" And he was like ""Ye, man, ye"", and that's how it started really.

[Murdoc & Russel]
And you just brought him along, you don't know his background?
(Man, just- that's how it started)

[2D]
But I don't know his background, no.

[Russel]
You, you know his foreground?

[2D]
I know his foreground, it's very clear, his foreground is very clear, background's a bit hazy.Embed"

Gorillaz,The Book of Murdoc,"4 ContributorsThe Book of Murdoc LyricsThe last anyone heard of Mudoc Niccals, he was living on Plastic Beach, an island in the South Pacific formed entirely from rubbish.

All was well, until the day Murdoc's tropical ghetto was raided by pirates. (Not the eye-patch king - those modern-day ones with machine guns and no sense of flair). Murdoc decided that evacuation was the bravest option, and fled heroically in a rusty brown submarine.

With only a crate of Psycho Jerry's Rum for sustenance and Cyborg Noodle for company, Murdoc navigated his way through the slimy Octopuses Garden. Cyborg Noodle proved the perfect shipmate for Murdoc: she didn't speak, she didn't judge, and she had absolutely no sense of smell.

Finally, when the booze ran out, Murdoc made to the surface and popped the hatch, releasing the rum-soaked air of the submersible like a kraken's guff. As he emptied his dangerously enlarged bladder, a giant shadow loomed over him. Two, if you count the ever-present memory of his disappointed father. But the other shadow was a ship: the Battleship Ringo, owned by music industry giant EMI.
Before it was chopped up and sold like a prize pig, EMI had sent a fleet of ships to search the globe for Murdoc. At last, they had him. The Gorillaz star was captured, slapped about a bit, and taken to a secret prison on London.

'Dungeon Abbey', beneath Abbey Road Studios, was built to detain the label's ABCs (Artists in Breach of Contract). For three years it served as Murdoc's home, until one day, he was offered a deal by Entertainment Internal Affairs. Like an unloved goldfish, the music industry was in dire need of Murdoc's legendary song-writing prowess. In exchange for his release (and a carton of Lucky Lungs cigarettes), Murdoc agreed to write a new Gorillaz album and moved immediately to a new studio home in West London.Embed"

Finally someone let me out of my bag
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm in a bag
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm in a bag
And I'm under each snare
Intangible

Look I'll make it all in a bag
Pick and choose
Sit and lose

Picture you gettin' in a bag too

Corruption in disguise
From this bag enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me in a bag
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor

On the broad to get her bra open

Gorillaz,The Book of Russel,"3 ContributorsThe Book of Russel LyricsRussel Hobbs had always put on weight easily, so when he grew sixty times in size swimming to Plastic Beach, he thought it might be his thyroid. Noodle, riding on his back the whole way, guessed it was more likely the six tons of polluted shrimp he'd swallowed en route.

Russel had found Murdoc, but like a circumcision ceremony their reunion was cruelly cut short. Pirates attacked from all sides, so Russell cradled Noodle inside his giant mouth and swam away.

Their trouble, however, was just beginning. Somewhere off the coast of Japan, Russel was mistaken for a whale and harpooned. He managed to wriggle free, but in the fracas Noodle was swept away into the blood-red waters.

Wounded and delirious, Russel struggled on through the ocean, feebly humming the power ballad All By Myself  until he lost consciousness. Eventually, he drifted into the warm waters of the Yellow Sea and washed up on a North Korean beach.

Giant Russel was carted to Pyongyang, where he was exhibited like a modern day Gulliver. The regime's Glorious Leader declared that he'd captured Pulgasari, the legendary North Korean Godzilla. Russel became the country's biggest attraction, and 'I survived Pulgasari' t-shirts became the nation's fastest selling fashion item. Or would have done if people were allowed to sell anything other than manure and tanks.

In time, the North's meagre food rations caused Russel to shrink back to normal size. Realising Russel was just a man, the Glorious Leader proclaimed that he'd personally defeated Pulgasari, and Russel was released. He was given a signed pressing of Kim Sings Sinatra, and sent back to England, where he wandered the streets of London, until musician and Gorillaz collaborator Jeff Wootton let him crash on his futon.

A few days later, Jeff's phone rang - it was Murdoc. Without delay, Russel moved into Murdoc's new West London home.

The band was getting back together.Embed"

Fall In love with Milan, Italy (yuh, yuh)

Too much cash make me laugh, hilarious
Too much flexin' got her mad, apparently
Thank god for the blessings (woah)
Feel good that my money straight
Pop a pill I get too geeked (yah)

In love with the money we married

Yo. Yo
Cause I'm this, Gorillaz from the mist lyricist and my thoughts be twisted
I spit the wickedest rhymes from a time that's never existed
My futuristic linguistics turn fools into statistics
I'm a lyrical misfit with the sadistic characteristics
I perform murderous acts on my tracks with a single breath
And if a boy wanna fi test, then I be stampin' upon his chest
Done makin' a mess - not a man could conceive the weed I'm consumin'
And I transform from my cartoon pseudonym, turn to a human
I spit words from my mouth that be turnin' you inside out
And I tie knots in intestines just like I'm a boy scout
That's workin' 'em out - Now rearrangin' your whole skeletal structure
Then I find some nine inch nails to perform some acupuncture
When I punch ya, I rupture one of your rib cage in a rage
And I turn you into a cartoon toon and erase the page

And demonstrate how I generate lyrics that supernaturally levitate

Take the ground from beneath your feet, leave you Skywalk-in' like Anakin
I'm sharper than the tips of Zulu spears and Olympic javelins

Going out my head, down to somewhere

Want mine back. I want my heart mend?

You pulled me fragile from the wreckage

Machine-assisted, I disappear
Into a dream, you don't wanna hear
How I got caught up in nowhere again

Through the infinite pages, I've scrawled out
Searching for a new world
That waits on the sunrise

They believed that a great reckoning was coming
A time when all the lies, and the shit, and the garbage
Piled up so high, a giant, writhing, supercharged mass would
Rise into the clouds, casting everything in shadow
But not all will be lost in the dark, for righteous are the lambs
Who nourish this great corruption
Feeding it more lies and malicious code, infecting it yet further
Until critical overload is reached, when all shall be wiped clean
And the tyranny of the algorithm shall be no more
And afterward, the collective of the new dawn will see clearly
For the first time, and learn the One True Story
A story which ends at the beginning of a new reality
When, as one being, we shall be born anew and rise again

When they read into the track from the dub reggae rap
When it comes to the Gorillaz we got stars in stacks
From the mental to the physical, we're tough and very lyrical
We shine, like the sun performing many miracles
Starshine, this is our time
We combine the design music that be standing on the frontline
The rough neck showing up our respect
Live and direct, we connect with a positive intellect
Starshining, Gorillaz be designing
The maddest and baddest with the music that's masterminded
Dazzling and rhyming with the music that's be defining
Gorillaz Starshine is so bright it's like you be blinded
Shining, me and the rest of Gorillaz stars
Our songs be lastin' past the existency of the last star
Strummin' guitars and flippin' lyrics bizarre
Gorillaz hotter than lava in the centre of the hottest star

Magical rhymes that's intertwined with the lines on the hard times

Gorillaz,Broken (Alternative),"2 ContributorsBroken (Alternative) LyricsDistant stars come in black or red
I've seen their worlds inside my head
They connect with the fall of man
They breathe you in and dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between when the tiding is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is an outer heart and the space has been broken

But he calls himself in the power of your name
You got me turned onto you
And it might be me and might be you
Calling in the outside

Is it far away in the glitter freeze?
Or in our eyes every time they meet
It's in the light of the plasma screens
We keep switched on all through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for her
She is a coincident, in a wrong line
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart and the space has been broken

It's broken
Our love
Broken
Its calling out loud for my name

From a winter wonderland, catching out

My mast ain't so sturdy
My head is at half
I'm searching the clouds for the score
My lady avails herself
Of marked down freedom
Forever cashed out to no more
She put the blam in the blame
Bullets bearing the name
Of each tigress who's left you a tooth
Save the skins for a pelt
And the rest for a belt
That can't open
No nothing
Can't open
No nothing

[Chorus]
Young liars
Thank you for taking my hands
Young liars
Oh thank you for taking my hands

[Verse 2]
Well it's cold and it's quiet
And cobblestone cold in here
Fucking for fear of not wanting
To fear again
Lonely is all we are
Lovely so far
But my heart's still a marble
In an empty jelly jar
Someday suppose that my
Curious nervousness
Spills into prescience
Clairvoyant consciousness
I will be calmer than cream
Making maps out of your dreams
But will psychic ability
Clinch the nativity?
Or simply diminish that flinch?
Oh young liars

I said thank you for taking my hands
And burying them deep in the world's wet womb
Where no one can heed their commands
Where no one can heed their commands except young liars

TV on the Radio,I Was a Lover,"12 ContributorsI Was a Lover LyricsI was a lover before this war
Held up in a luxury suite, behind a well-barricaded door
Now that I've cleaned up, gone legit
I can see clearly, round hole
Round hole, square peg don't fit

I'm locked in my bedroom, so send back the clowns
My clone wears a brown shirt
And I seduce him when there's no one around
Mano y mano on a bed of nails
Bring it on like a storm
'Til I knock the wind out of his sails
And we don't make eye contact when we have run-ins in town
Just a barely polite nod
And nervous stares towards the ground
I once joined a priest class, plastic, inert
Slow-danced with commerce
Like a lens up a skirt
And we liked to party
And we kept it live
And we had a three volume tome of contemporary slang
To keep a handle on all this jive

Ennui unbridled, let's talk to kill the time
How many styles did you cycle through before you were mine?
And it's been a while since we went wild and that's all fine
But we're sleepwalking through this trial
And it's really a crime, it's really a crime, it's really a crime
It's really criminal

Running on empty, bourbon and God

Into a rest stop for the dead
And did it all in gold and blue and gray

The efforts to allay your dread
In spite of all you knew and said
Were hard to see and harder still to say

A comfort plush all laced in lead
Was sent to quell your sentiment
And keep your trembling sentinel hand at bay

And when a sudden silhouette
Escaped the top side of your bed
I knew you'd never ever be the same

Ah, is it not me
Am I not folded by your touch
The words you spoke, I know too much
It's over now and not enough
Ah, is it not me
The damage you hold inside your blush
The load you towed, you showed it up
It's over now and I'm insane

Wild spirit winds from out your chest
Collides with world and wilderness

He's a what? He's a what? He's a newspaper man
And he gets his best ideas from a newspaper stand
From his boots to his pants to his comments and his rants
He knows that any little article will do
Though he expresses some confusion about his part in the plan
And he can't understand that he's not in command
The decisions underwritten by the cash in his hand
Bought a sweater for his weimaraner, too
Now I'm no mad man but that's insanity
Feast before famine and more before family
Goes and shows up with more bowls and more cups
And the riot for the last hot meal erupts
Corrupts his hard drive through the leanest months
Shells out the hard cash for the sickest stunts
On aftershave, on gasoline
He flips the page and turns the scene

Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little things
Past the right now, right now, the right now, love
Letting go of the source of loss
Embracing what can't be bought
Had me thinking about the nature of want
An imaginary need for the silly little dream
Past the right now3Embed"
TV on the Radio,Love Stained,"8 ContributorsLove Stained Lyrics[Verse 1]
Funny now it's all out
See what only nakedness could hide
Something's got you tongue tied
Like you're barely handling the ride

Sentimental storm clouds
Gathering, let's try pray them down
They've been there the whole time
Following from crib, to crawl to walk, to run, to slow

[Chorus 1]
Live and die for it
Simulating blood baths in bed
Or red, we're wed
And unembarrassed to dare this affair with

No brutalized romance or criticized slow dance
Your head's your head
But still we're not afraid to share
This with careful awareness

[Post-Chorus 1]
In the middle of the night, when fear comes calling
Sayin' ""It all dies, often scared, alone...""
Look into your eyes and feel your calm
Pretty thing that catches me so strong when I fall

Another shining morning
Hand to breast, grief's got you by the lungs
Wanna cease the mourning
But it seems that sad song's never done

Drop cold feet to floor and
Suddenly the whole thing weighs a ton
Same body that you dance in
Bring it back to me, lick, and roll and raise your inner sun

[Chorus 2]
Live and die for it
Swearing by black mass in bed
We're fed, we're wed
And unembarrassed to share this affair with

No brutalized romance or criticized slow dance
My head's my head
But still we're not afraid
To say for ourselves what a pair is

[Post-Chorus 2]
In the middle of the light, just wanna be your darling
Running by your side, let me play along
Look into your eyes, see the love we're born in
Hear your heart so sweetly beat, just wanna sing its song

Everything's alright, just let me be your darling
Running by your side, nevermore alone
Look into your eyes and see the love we're born in
Hear your heart so sweetly beat, just wanna sing its songEmbed"

Gave no reason for letting go
I just thought you might like to know
You're the only one I ever loved
True
We've demolished a thing or two

Threw your hands up and walked away

Watch its guts pump poison into sting
Watch it reach completeness, see it fall asleep
Legs above fold in eternal dream

Oh, that calls to mind a joke, an off coloring
About these fools blindfolded, drugged, and raped and left laughing
They let the devil in, he brought his pirate friends
They brought a hunger for blood and flesh and bone and skin

So teeth left chattering and tongues flexed to sing
Got dressed up in so many fancy things

Is it a waste of time? Tell me if you mind
Me dipping into useless sentimentality
A rant on how things used to be when this shit was free
I answered my own question, I can hear the crickets yawning
But in the back pocket of a discarded pair of jeans
Is still a priceless ticket to the grandest opening
So when the chariot arrives you'd best enjoy the ride
'Cause when we get to Heaven's gate we're not getting inside

Better beg forgiveness
Better drop to knees
Better find your ticket

In the dark of the night I found
Without my love, my love
These words are not a bit profound
If it's just another cheap line flung

Outside ecstatic love
What did we think we'd find?
Over that broken road
Out past the land mines

I'm going to keep your heart
I'm going to keep your heart
With the world all falling apart
I'm going to keep your heart

Can I coax it out its shell
Brush the dust off
Get its wings on
In this little bell
We will also feel the singing, oh

Shine on, light of love
On all these bruises and scars
Ruins in every less
But it can't cancel out the stars

It could only be hinted at with metaphor
Crudely drawn clichéd form
But I knew what I knew

You could see it when he moved
And danced to the tune of love so true

Now it's over and you're cold

Know the tale skip to the end
Maybe you're achin' but try it again

Then it goes
A million miles an hour
Think you'll let it take you home
Freeze your golden hour
When you let love break your heart

As you're weeping through the miracle
After all that we've been through
Thought I heard them say

Vampire life steez, but I’m no Jim Jones
Cold as wind blow, through my window
Can’t sleep tonight, or until the morning
Rub one out or get a bone in, eat some melatonin
Equal parts Dolph Lundgren and a dolphin
Endorphins, Mighty like the Morphin
Power, Rangers, my life’s stranger
Life’s a bitch, but I don’t wanna try to change her
My arms achin’, and my legs too
Look at me sideways, try to behead you
Wanna roll the sun up and smoke it, no jokin’
Bumpin’ rails of the moon like hocus pocus
Slow kid make dough chips
He focused, but dopin’
Colder than the winter get to warmer than the dinner is
Catch me at the crib watchin’ TV on the internet

Ham and cheese (w)rap, I don’t even eat that
Pitchfork.com I don’t even read that
Blood of a tiger, heart of a king
Carlos Estévez, more or less Mexican
Brown Adonis, but more honest
More charmless, more harmless
Riding on a ???? with no harness
Arms for the armless, farms for the farmless
Ring the alarm, it’s the wolf in sheep’s garments
I’m Cheech Marin at the Chicano art opening sponsored by Target
Chancletas on the red carpet, faux Marxist
Throw me in the tar pit, La Brea like
My way plus the highway, Kamehameha like
The whole game lame, players stay alike
Wack, dumb, stupid, I could be all three plus I could lay the pipe
Sometimes I feel like I wanna die, but I was born in the sky

TV on the Radio,Netti Fretti,"3 ContributorsNetti Fretti Lyrics[Italian Singing]

[Radio DJ]
You are tuned in to WQED Classical 89.9 on your FM dial. The time is now 3:15. We just heard 'Netti Fretti Con Volante', written in 1899 by the renowned Scotch-Italian composer Shamus Vitilago, preformed by the choir St. Martin-in-the-Field in Minnesota. DJ Bullshit conducting, this was recorded just last year, in Minnesota. Not much is known about Shamus Vitilago; he was well renowned, but mostly for his antics, for his theater. He was a midget, peg-legged drunkard who toured incessantly with the circus, and also had an unparalleled ear for dissonance and atonality. He lead a strange life and suffered an equally strange fate. He was beaten to death by the painter Caravaggio in 1899 after debuting the song we just heard now. The litelul- litera- excuse me... literal translation for which follows as such:

[?]; This whore has rescued me, necrophilia can wait
[?]; My madness explains its need to kill
[?]; Us on her bed, her godless bed, begin our gruesome exchange
[?]; A burning net with wings is what love is

And the chorus of the song, that magnificent sweeping chorus:

[?]; I pull out on the brink of unconsciousness and spackle Gena with my ejaculate

Bold images. Strong, strong images, wonderfully sung. The song was dedicated to Caravaggio and his beautiful new wife, Gena. Classical 89.9, the time is now 3:20. Ping-Pong recording examples will be next, input select switches are on. Please stay tunedYou might also likeEmbed"

Woah
(slow times for you?)[x2]
(what's a boy to do?)

[Verse 1]
From my parapet I spy out the corner of my eye
On the street where you walk on by your beauty on the run from me
Come to me, I beckon but I reckon since it's mentally
Not dust to thee, my density can hinder your mobility
So what? another vision fades into the twisted (faded) cityscapes
Like trying to find twin snowflakes looking for another heart to break
Oh, she break me equally I pray to my dead god to send
A sullen siren just to silence my automaton tongue

[Chorus] [x4]
Tell me what to do
So I don't hurt you

[Verse 2]
He came through, blank book, on the train, new catastrophe
My god, there's a body on the train right in front of me
Don't look, she's a demon, strolls the sewers, no apologies
I need a dirty girl to help me brush up my biology
This way to a place, she's right in front of me
I can pray, and she got it 'cuz she got it where she wants to be
Run through, spread down like a naked buffet
We gonna (mangerie[?]) and then play for days
So first we spark and blaze and then we go away
And then we go away and then we go three way
(And then we shift our fate and then my baby say)
So first we spark and blaze and then we blow away
(So first we spark and blaze and then we play for days)
And then we play for days and then we go away
(And then we spark and blaze and then we go three way)
And then we spark and blaze and then we play for days
(And then my baby says and then we spark and blaze)
And then we go three way and the my baby say
(And then we go three way and then we shift our face)

[Verse 3]
Roll out from the bedside and cut from the past
Roll home, kicking lovely and lonely at last
Cigarette all ablaze as I tread the rat's maze
And I see every passing beauty, all these mindless cuties
All this youthful booty for a boy to tap
Better fall into my chamber 'fore I fall into the trap
A skin addiction, a benediction for all my pistons
Every lay in moderation on this permanent vacation

[Outro]
I'm fading
Oh, I can't keep fading
All's after
I'm fading
Woah

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well

It was rare, you remember it all too well

The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

[Verse 2]
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
And then she wrotе headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say

All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

[Bridge]
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you

[Verse 3]
And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singin'
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
And our town, it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, ""Thank you, Aimee"" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
So I pushed each boulder up that hill
Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby

Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice

[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over
[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""
I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this

Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles

Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed

'Cause something counterfeit's dead?

What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion

Nice to meet you, where you been?

Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy

I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

Without ever touchin' his skin

In lowercase, inside a vault

Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me

From a friend of friends of mine

And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give

Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion

Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?

In fifty years, will all this be declassified?

'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing

But you are what you did

Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders

Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny

Our past days were the fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
Well, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time
Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine
All my girls got their lace and their crimes
And your cheating husband disappeared, well
No one asks any questions here
So I did my best to lay to rest
All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
Is that a bad thing to say in a song?

Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so

Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Fresh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 1]
Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 2]
Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again

Watch me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile
All those nights, he kept me goin'
Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'

[Bridge]
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place

That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen

It looks like you're tryin' lives on

I remember

[Verse 1]
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'
'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?

Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

[Bridge]
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight
[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)

On a six-lane Texas highway

And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering

[Verse 2]
If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us

Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

Starin' out an open window, catchin' my death
And I couldn't be sure

That this pain would be for

I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days

Is there a line that I could just go cross?
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)
(If you think of all the cost)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)

(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)

Quick, quick, tell me something awful
Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize
You see, I was a debutante in another life, but
Now I seem to be scared to go outside
If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck
Now that I know what's what

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

[Verse 2]
My friends used to play a game where
We would pick a decade
We wished we could live in instead of this
I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists
And getting married off for the highest bid
Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now
Seems like it was never even fun back then
Nostalgia is a mind's trick
If I'd been there, I'd hate it
It was freezing in the palace

I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

[Bridge]
I'm lonely, but I'm good
I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine
I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose
This place made me feel worthless
Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me
And in my fantasies, I rise above it
And way up there, I actually love it

Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother

Full of cages, full of fences

Now and then, she rereads the manuscript
Of the entire torrid affair
They compared their licenses
He said, ""I'm not a donor but
I'd give you my heart if you needed it""
She rolled her eyes and said
""You're a professional""
He said, ""No, just a good samaritan""
He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
Soon, they'd be pushin' strollers
But, soon, it was over

[Verse 2]
In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press
Afterwards, she only atе kids' cereal
And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
Then she dated boys who were her own age
With dart boards on the backs of their doors
She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
Everything had been above board
She wasn't sure

[Bridge]
And the years passed like scenes of a show
The professor said to write what you know
Lookin' backwards might be the only way to move forward
Then the actors were hitting their marks
And the slow dance was alight with the sparks
And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
And at last, she knew what the agony had been for

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?

And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man

They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve

Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke

Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now

(Uh-oh, uh-oh)

[Verse 1]
We hereby conduct this post-mortem
He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
Our maladies were such we could not cure them
And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign

[Chorus]
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
We must know
How did it end?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learned thе right steps to different dancеs
And fell victim to interlopers' glances
Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins

""Guess who we ran into at the shops?
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear? They called it all off""
One gasp and then
""How did it end?""

[Bridge]
Say it once again with feeling
How the death rattle breathing
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming
Leaving me bereft and reeling
My beloved ghost and me
Sitting in a tree

[Pre-Chorus]
It's happenin' again
How did it end?
I can't pretend like I understand
How did it end?

We'll tell no one except all of our friends
But I still don't know

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight

Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard

Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place

Shifting eyes and vacancy

Starts to make its way to me

Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy

Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride

I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright

And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

Everything was right, Mr. ""I've been waitin' for you all my life""
Mr. ""Every single day until the end, I will be by your side""

But that was when I got to know Mr. ""Change of heart""
Mr. ""Leaves me all alone,"" I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

[Verse 2]
Mr. ""Never told me why,"" Mr. ""Never had to see me cry""
Mr. ""Insincere apology, so he doesn't look like the bad guy""
He goes about his day, forgets he ever even heard my name

So far above feelin' anything
And it's really such a shame

In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye

Tell 'em how I hope they shine

Break my soul in two looking for you

Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering, where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me?
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging

I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire

When she was six in frigid water
And I can confirm she made
A curious child, ever reviled
By everyone except her own father
With a quite bewitching face
Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
Then she runs like it's a race
Behind her back, her best mates laughed
And they nicknamed her ""The Bolter""

Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving

The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin'
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2]
There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it

Even if it's a false god

Everyone swimmin' in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feelin' so Gatsby for that whole year

There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shakin' my hand

They tell you while you're young
""Girls, go out and have your fun""
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, ""She looks like she's been through it""

Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?

How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?

When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

[Verse 2]
When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met

[Chorus]
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine

I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face

[Chorus]
In the 1500s, off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine

I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind

And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine

(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

[Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift]
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screamin' at the palace front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
My castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down)

You don't wanna know me now, now

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't comin'
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace, ah
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

Taylor Swift,Why She Disappeared [Poem],"34 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoРусскийSvenskaPortuguêsFrançaisWhy She Disappeared [Poem] LyricsWhen she fell, she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends

When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
""Whatever you say, it is not right.""
""Whatever you do, it is not enough.""
""Your kindness is fake.""
""Your pain is manipulative.""

When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.

When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes

When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $72When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
""May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice""
And even louder:
""without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here.""
And in the death of her reputation,
She felt truly alive.30Embed"

You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul

Gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids, when keeping it how it is
Will only break their hearts worse

Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different

While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time

Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""

You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?

Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something

So many walls up, I can't break through

Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
You can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child

She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it

Let them say what they want, we won't hear it

Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket
You wore to the wrong part of town
Desire is the sound of the whiskey
Telling me you miss me, can you come around?

Passion is a passing thing
It's accidental chemistry
Lust is a liar, a short-lived fire
It ain't what you and I are at all

Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, ""I won't let you go""
I won't leave, it's a need

Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck
That tell me to run or to freeze
Fear is the nightmare I had, you were with someone else

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Taylor Swift,If You’re Anything Like Me [Poem],"32 ContributorsTranslationsSvenskaPortuguêsРусскийFrançaisIf You’re Anything Like Me [Poem] LyricsIf you're anything like me,
You bite your nails,
And laugh when you're nervous.
You promise people the world,
because that's what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
But darling, you need to stop,

If you're anything like me,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
If life gets too good now,
Darling, it scares you.
If you're anything like me,
You never wanted to lock your door,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
But Darling, now you have to.

If you're anything like me,
There's a justice system in your head
For names you'll never speak again,
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you,
In your own little golden prison cell...
But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $72If you're anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
But Darling, you keep trying.

If you're anything like me,
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...
Darling, later on you will thank your stars
for that frightful day.

If you're anything like me,
I'm sorry.

But Darling, it's going to be okay.24Embed"

Taylor Swift,Reputation [Prologue],"30 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolРусскийPortuguêsFrançaisReputation [Prologue] LyricsHere's something I've learned about people.

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.

This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.

The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.
When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?

Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...
We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.

There will be no further explanation

There will be just reputation.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $7215Embed"

Taylor Swift,Fifteen,"72 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisEspañolPortuguêsFifteen Lyrics[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

Find myself at your door

In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

No reasons why

The wrong ones think they’re right

You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget

Stumbled through the long goodbye

But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

Taylor Swift,Mary’s Song (Oh My My My),"51 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolAfrikaansTürkçePolskiPortuguêsMary’s Song (Oh My My My) Lyrics[Verse 1]
She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""

[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 AM riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my

[Bridge]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

[Chorus]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh, my, my, my15Embed"

I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else

Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you

So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

Born into nothing

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fеarless

[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this onе-horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

Taylor Swift,I Knew You Were Trouble (Intro),"16 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolI Knew You Were Trouble (Intro) LyricsI think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again,
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought,
How can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him
It was losing me.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $722Embed"

Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand...
And then he said, ""It's too late to apologize""

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would've been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waitin' for you to walk in
But the time is tickin'
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughin'
As I'm lookin' around the room
But therе was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knеw

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's somethin' really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feelin' starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughin'
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missin'

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standin' around me, singin'
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knew

And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""

When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people

Every time I don't, I almost do

Taylor Swift,​cardigan (voice memo),"14 ContributorsTranslationsFrançais​cardigan (voice memo) LyricsSo first of all, I'm obsessed with, like, pretty much all of these tracks, and it was really hard to figure out like what I wanted to write first because I had thoughts for all of them, so, unbelievable archives, I can't believe you have this just, like, laying around, that's ... ridiculous, these are unbelievable. But anyway, the first one that I... I was working something up for is the ""Maple"" one? And I came up with this thing, and it's probably gonna obviously like be sequencing differences like, you know, different lengths and different verses and whatever, but this is just like a rough, uh, thing. 

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Living in a gold age
Sneaking to my bird cage, I
I knew you
Laughing like a damn fool
Breaking every damn rule, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Instrumental Break]
And then, I have like this-- there's like a break, because I don't really know what's gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think it's here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing. 

[Bridge]
And to kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
Now I'm bleedin'
I'm bleedin'

[Instrumental Break]
We'll work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, there's all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait 'til then, and then, I start singing again. I don't think it's right now, but... there it is. The ending. 
[Chorus]
I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter leaving Wendy, I
I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
That when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
I knew I'd wish you would've changed your mind
I knew you'd miss me once the moment died
I knew to love would be to lose my mind

And then, I don't know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, that's just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it. 2Embed"

And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not pickin' up

'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

[Verse 2]
Well, me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said

[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down cryin', was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess
I need you20Embed"

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

[Verse 3]
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
But I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be

It was all over the place
A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end
Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild
And tortured by memories past

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Stay, stay, stay""
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me

[Chorus]
No choice but to stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

Vanished when I saw your face

Starts to make its way to me

Like passing notes in secrecy

Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""I can't take my eyes off of you""
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Bridge]
You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""I can't take my eyes off of you""
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

[Outro]
Sweet, sweet superstar

All this time, I was wastin', hopin' you would come around
I've been givin' out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinkin' we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
You're lookin' so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waitin' in the cold
And you've got your sharе of secrets and I'm tired of bein' last to know, oh
And now you're askin' me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no
You're not sorry
No, no

You had me crawlin' for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothin' left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no
You're not sorry
No, no

[Outro]
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no
No, no14Embed"
